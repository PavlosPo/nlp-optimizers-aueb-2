       " 'But there certainly should be.\\nThese are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France\\'s Essilor is the world\\'s number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy\\'s Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.\\nIt is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.\\n\"The parties\\' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\\nBut there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\\nGordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.\\n\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\\n\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\\nIf the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\\nIt will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician\\'s shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\\nOne long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\\n\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\\nIn his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\\n\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\\nUnless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\\nBut if you have been inside an optician\\'s shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\\nJust a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\\nWhen it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\\nFor its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\\nIn 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people\\'s noses.\\nThe overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.\\nMarket research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\".\\nEven so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\\nThese are:\\nAn inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\\nA Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.\\n\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\\n\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\\nThe EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\\nBut the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\\n\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\\n\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\\nIf you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\\nOf course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\\nOpticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\\nThey also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\\nBut for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\\nOn worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\\nFor the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.\\nWith cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.\\nWill customers benefit as well?',\n",

I don\\'t think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race.\\n\"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities.\\n\"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative.\\n\"Medals at any cost, that\\'s how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\"\\nHouvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age.\\n\"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn\\'t seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012.\\n\"They didn\\'t care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them.\\n\"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don\\'t feel was right.\"\\nFourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying.\\nAsked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It\\'s a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals.\\n\"It\\'s not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through.\\n\"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they\\'ll be dealt with.\"',\n",

But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn\\'t making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.\\n\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\\n\"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\\nMr Badr says it\\'s still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\\n\"That\\'s basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\\n\"It\\'s not just entertaining them, it\\'s also informing them,\" he says. \"There\\'s a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that\\'s on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\\nBut clubs don\\'t only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night\\'s takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\\n\"It\\'s an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there\\'s the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you\\'re contracted at.\\n\"If it\\'s somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who\\'s had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\\n\"And if you\\'re just a knock out comic, then you\\'re coming in and getting a door deal. You\\'re taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\\n\"It\\'s become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they\\'ll book him almost sight unseen. That\\'s it.\\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\\nHe says: \"We all thought \\'who\\'s going to come to a comedy club? The dream\\'s over, I\\'ve got to get a real job now\\'.\\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.\\n\"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"',\n",

BT\\'s retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about Â£40bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about Â£10bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.\\nSenior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT\\'s rivals would like to see spun off.\\nSeparating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.\\nCreating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.\\nBT\\'s share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company\\'s owners.\\nThis holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.\\nIt also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.\\nBT\\'s chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.\\nIf they prove too much at odds with BT\\'s own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.',\n",

       " \"Media playback is not supported on this device\\nOf his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine.\\nWinning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable.\\nAnd yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price.\\nMurray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern.\\nOpting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer?\\nAlthough it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nMurray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets.\\nAs well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells.\\nThough he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open.\\nSo, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon.\\nMurray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final.\\nIt would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years.\\nYet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field.\\nHe has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way.\\nThis year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%.\\nHe claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden.\\nBut perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter.\\nThat may not be a concern much longer.\\nMurray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest.\\nIn fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further.\\nNadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further.\\nAnd then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\",\n",

About 20 to 30 people were there.\\n\"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn\\'t just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them.\\n\"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them.\\n\"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool.\\n\"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff.\\n\"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous.\\n\"It wasn\\'t just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage.\\n\"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn\\'t give a serious answer, and that\\'s how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that\\'s why I think they liked it in the Cavern.\\n\"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren\\'t trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose.\\n\"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them.\\n\"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn\\'t really concentrate on doing any work.\\n\"Just in a few weeks they\\'d gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you\\'d seen them, not many people didn\\'t go to see them again.\\n\"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I\\'d dumped them.\\n\"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal.\\n\"I wasn\\'t the only one. I think the ones who thought that they\\'d discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me.\"\\nAlex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs.\\nThe Cavern is celebrating the anniversary with a series of tribute events on Wednesday. A documentary about the first gig will be broadcast on ITV1 at 2240 GMT on Wednesday.',\n",

All social partners will now decide what their take is.\"\\nHe said the panel was not endorsing the proposed figure as a living wage, but wanted to set a minimum payment for workers.\\nWages are politically sensitive in the country, where the official unemployment rate is close to 25%.\\nOne employment expert reckoned the figure was only about a quarter of the amount needed for the upkeep of a typical South African working-class household.\\nProf Chris Malikane of the University of Witwatersrand told a Johannesburg radio station: \"You would need 12,000 rand to sustain a basic household.\"\\nThe African National Congress, South Africa\\'s ruling party, supported the proposal calling it \"credible and clearly supported by clear evidence\".\\nHowever, the Economic Freedom Fighters, the country\\'s third largest political party, said the plan \"favours business at the expense of workers\".\\nIt called for a higher minimum wage of at least 4,500 rand.\\nSouth Africa faces a possible downgrade to sub-investment grade by credit ratings agencies next month, with concerns remaining over violent wage strikes.\\nMoody\\'s currently rates South Africa two notches above subinvestment grade, with a negative outlook, while Fitch and S&P Global Ratings have it just a step above \"junk\".\\nHowever, Mr Ramaphosa said: \"We have made tremendous progress on the labour instability issues,\"',\n",
       " 'Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region.\\nFor many of Ethiopia\\'s Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration.\\nMr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame.\\nA mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught.\\nTo use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over.\\nBut he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore.\\nThe diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma.\\nSince 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism.\\nDomestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime.\\nHe was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship.\\nHis message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia.\\nHis concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order.\\nMeasured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring.\\nThe much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele.\\nBut it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty.\\nThe democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress\", has long stalled.\\nSince the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents.\\nWhy West will miss Meles\\nObituary: Meles Zenawi\\nLife in pictures: Ethiopia\\'s Meles Zenawi\\nA plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time.\\nFeeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival.\\nHe orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People\\'s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents.\\nHis death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising.\\nThat said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus.\\nThe opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up.\\nMr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically.\\nHe is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent\\'s key priorities and demands at global forums.\\nHe did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent\\'s great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable.\\nNot in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse.\\nFrom the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought.\\nMany embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders.\\nThe Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country\\'s profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests.\\nHe swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991.\\nThe two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea.\\nHostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border.\\nIt is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension.\\nThat would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond.\\nIn Somalia, Ethiopia\\'s military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia.\\nThe death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia.\\nThere are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview.\\nSuch fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia\\'s history and political fragility.\\nHowever, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.',\n",

There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further £500m per year.\\nThis would be covered by the £48.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments.\\nBut there are lower estimates.\\nLabour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students.\\nBut the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around £7.5bn to £8bn.\\nLabour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction.\\nBut they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments.\\nThe most recent figures show £76bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years.\\nFrom this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the £10,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1%.\\nAnd the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors.\\nUnder Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government.\\nBut is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged?\\nUniversities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion.\\nOne of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates.\\nThe argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees.\\nThis year has seen a fall of 5% in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased.\\nBut the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration.\\nAlthough wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest.\\nDo students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects?\\nDepartment for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned £10,000 per year more.\\nAmong younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at £6,000 per year.\\nBut the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade.\\nLabour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters.\\nA survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections.\\nThe survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote.\\nThe Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives.\\nIs this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government?\\nCould they really entirely scrap fees?\\nThere will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees.\\nGermany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees.\\nFrench undergraduates can study for low fees.\\nIn the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about £100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes.\\nThere are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton.\\nAnd the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland.\\nFor England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades.\",\n",

She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks.\\nDuring an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud.\\nIt is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers.\\nEmma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day.\\nOne of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices.\\nDespite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state.\\n\"I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn\\'t for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I\\'d been experiencing for years,\" she said.\\n\"Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health.\\n\"I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume.\\n\"I feel so much better and intend to keep this up.\"\\nThe evidence of food\\'s link to mental states has been growing.\\nA landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology.\\nPlus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks.\\nUnfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients.\\nThis has to change.\\nMany of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up.\\nWhen we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term.\\nBut, this can actually make things worse in the long term.\\nThe food you are eating is literally \"shocking\" your body.\\nBy changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks.\\nShe also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress.\\nIt has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health.\\nOf course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional.\\nThere can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood.\\nAs a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you:\\n1. Reduce sugar and processed foods\\nSugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise.\\nWithin two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall.\\nAt this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel \"h-angry\" as well - hungry and angry.\\nLow and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body\\'s stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline.\\nThis can have a negative impact on your mood.\\n2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fats\\nThis is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders.\\nFoods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies), grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables.\\n3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnuts\\nTryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter.\\nEat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood.\\n4. Feed your gut bugs\\nSome scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain\\'s peacekeepers.\\nIt is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis.\\nThe prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut.\\nBest options are leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower.\\nYou have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate.\\nSee how food can impact mental health on Doctor in the House, Monday, 21:00 BST on BBC One.',\n",

       " 'A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world.\\nFor that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world\\'s central banks.\\nThere have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability.\\nThere are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates.\\nWith the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due.\\nCentral banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it \"will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review\".\\nOther central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it\\'s needed.\\nWhat if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs?\\nThere are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently.\\nWith sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves.\\nIn the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets.\\nSo if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value.\\nConversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency.\\nFurther action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that.\\nCurrency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however.\\nInterest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall.\\nBoth options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks.\\nFurther quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value).\\nInterest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank\\'s target (2%).\\nAnother risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago.\\nThose earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market.\\nSome observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive.\\nThe likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period.\\nThe ECB\\'s option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.',\n",

       " 'According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men.\\nGiven such a dire prognosis, and let\\'s face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it\\'s because men are squeamish, or don\\'t like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed \"the Cinderella cancer\".\\n\"We just don\\'t make enough of it\" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. \"On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked\".\\nBased at Addenbrooke\\'s Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered.\\n\"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour.\"\\nBut if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage?\\nThat - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer.\\nThe results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer.\\n\"It\\'s shocking, but we still don\\'t have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer,\" says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. \"That\\'s because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn\\'t accurate enough and you\\'d have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years\".\\nIf that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery.\\nSitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon\\'s, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive.\\nAs with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum.\\n\"The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery\" says Prof Neal. \"It\\'s still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we\\'re able to save. That\\'s got to be good news for the patient\".',\n",

Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles.\\nHowever, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says.\\nIS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km (43 miles) south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July.\\nBy comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair.\\nMirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport.\\nStratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport.\\nAlong with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base.\\nIn contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS.\\nAfter the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them.\\nHowever, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage to the buildings.\\nSatellite imagery released last week, showed how IS had constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the northern Iraqi city.\",\n",

       " 'Media playback is not supported on this device\\nSince dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better.\\nBut that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don\\'t know what\\'s what: you might be in the driver\\'s seat but your hands aren\\'t on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there\\'s a brick on the accelerator pedal.\\nAnother way of looking at it is that Fury\\'s crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman\\'s stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope.\\nBut not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it\\'s anyone\\'s guess as to when - if ever - he\\'ll have his keys back and his engine revving again.\\nFury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock.\\nWhen I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as \"an all-action man in anything I do. If I\\'m drinking, I\\'m drinking until I can\\'t stand up. If I\\'m going out for Chinese, I\\'m going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I\\'m eating cake, I\\'m eating the whole cake. I don\\'t know what you\\'d call me. An idiot, maybe?\"\\nHardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people.\\nFury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won\\'t be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice.\\nThe repeated claims from Fury\\'s camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional\\nAfter pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn\\'t train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old.\\nJess Willard\\'s victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas\\'s upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn\\'t fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey.\\nSometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn\\'t been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a \"witch hunt\" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury\\'s sometimes rambling trains of thought.\\nBefore and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury\\'s controversial outbursts.\\nAs such, the repeated claims from Fury\\'s camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury\\'s performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right.\\nBut the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what\\'s happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in.\\nWhen Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers.\\nFury\\'s camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations.\" How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship?\\nIn threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday\\'s Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it\\'s in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs?\\nIf you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury\\'s Traveller heritage doesn\\'t come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned.\\n\"I know Tyson personally and he\\'s a really nice guy,\" says Ricky Hatton, Fury\\'s fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. \"But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous.\"\\nFury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation\\'s mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua\\'s brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them.\\nHowever, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable.\\nWhen you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him.\\nOn Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC\\'s general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, \"cocaine is against the law of the land\".\\nThere was also Fury\\'s alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn\\'t be anywhere near a boxing ring.\\nIt should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing\\'s image to think about - as mad as that sounds.\\nEven if Fury hadn\\'t voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them.\\nIt might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: \"We can\\'t have a belt held hostage.\"\\nOne can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused.\\n\"Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him,\" was Hatton\\'s grim assessment. \"He doesn\\'t like boxing and finds the training hard. It\\'s not looking good.\\n\"But I was in a dark place, didn\\'t care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same.\"\\nFingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.',\n",

It has shades of the convenient \"lone wolf\" theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it?\\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand\\nHere is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now.\\nWhat I don\\'t buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It\\'s cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it\\'s not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you.\\nSome players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you\\'re not big enough then choose another profession. It\\'s not a game for all shapes and sizes any more.\\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards.\\nPerhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice.\\nSo is it possible to get big enough taking food alone?\\nThe IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website. It states: \"The IRB carried out 1,542 tests both in and out of competition in 2012, across all IRB tournaments and events, including the HSBC Sevens World Series, Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifiers, men\\'s and women\\'s Tests and Age Grade Rugby.\\n\"The programme saw a total of 21 anti-doping rule violation cases, equating to 1.36% of the IRB\\'s entire programme.\"\\nThat means around 1.4% of elite level players take drugs and try to get away with it. Some of them, you can see from the website, were caught taking the steroid favoured by both Sam Chalmers and disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, stanozolol.\\nThe 2011 Word Anti-Doping Agency figures, also available on the IRB website, show there were 5,553 drug tests globally in rugby in 2011, and 61 violations within them - just over 1%.\\nMy guess is that there are more chancing it lower down the leagues, or in that scramble to get into the system - but I don\\'t know.\\nWhen I was in South Africa covering the 1995 Rugby World Cup I wrote then what I repeat now - that the biggest growth in requests at GPs in Capetown nearly 20 years ago was from schoolboys wanting prescriptions for steroids. They were often accompanied by parents.\\nCould this happen here?\\nSam Chalmers was in the most susceptible group, which is young lads who want to get into professional, or at least top-level, rugby.\\nIt\\'s going to be tough on him. But life\\'s not easy. It wasn\\'t easy for the players and coaches in the \"Bloodgate\" affair, or in the various eye-gouging allegations, nor for the other 60-odd rugby players caught by the IRB taking drugs or tampering with their samples.\\nThis is a test. He does his time and then he gets back in the game.\\nI will leave you with this thought: I bet you he wasn\\'t alone in this. And I bet there are younger players than Sam Chalmers who haven\\'t been caught.\\nWhat do you think? Are there pressures on players to take steroids?\\nYou can follow John Beattie on Twitter @bbcjohnbeattie',\n",

       " '\"Did you set this up?\" Salford City Reds owner Dr Marwan Koukash asked, at the start of the station\\'s rugby league hour this week.\\nThe extravagant millionaire has grabbed the ailing Reds by the scruff of the neck and set about building a dream in arguably the sport\\'s most crucial year.\\nHaving ruffled feathers with his breathtakingly bold bids to sign Sam Tomkins and Adrian Morley, Koukash has promised to make the Super League strugglers the biggest rugby club in the country within three to four years. What he has definitely done is make people talk about Salford again.\\nFar from being a prickly atmosphere in the studio, there appeared to be real warmth between the extrovert racehorse owner, the man he wants to coach his club - Brian Noble, and the rugby league legend he wants to sign from Warrington - Adrian Morley.\\n\"The more Marwan\\'s the merrier, the better,\" said Noble, the former Great Britain and Bradford Bulls coach still waiting for the right opportunity to return to the sport. \"You just need passionate people with some substance behind them to push the game forward. His passion fills you with enthusiasm, you want to get going and get cracking.\"\\nThose comments will have been music to the ears of the fiercely ambitious Koukash, who learned the art of hard work during three years in a refugee camp in Jordan.\\nHe admits he would be honoured for Noble to coach the team he is attempting to assemble at Salford. Another Brian - the Australian Brian Smith - is the other frontrunner.\\nI understand Noble is keen to work with Koukash, but only if he is convinced the dream of this businessman, tempted into the sport by the RFL\\'s chief executive Nigel Wood, can become a reality.\\nA similar discussion about ambition and available funds saw Noble drop out of the running for the Castleford Tigers job before the appointment of Ian Millward, so Salford fans should not expect this to be a done deal.\\nKey to the \\'Good Doctor\\'s\\' dream - he was labelled the \\'Mad Doctor\\' during his outlandish early claims of racehorse success - is his campaign to raise the sport\\'s £1.8m salary cap. Koukash has, for the past few weeks, been lobbying to lift the limit that a club can spend on players to something nearer £2.5m.\\nHis argument is that this will not only make the rugby league a more attractive proposition for the best players in Australia and halt a talent drain to rugby union, but even reverse the process and tempt union players to league.\\nNoble agrees that the cap may need a rethink - it was introduced to stop clubs overspending. But the only man to coach a club to three Super League Grand Final victories believes we might now need a carrot to bring in the bigger names to raise the sport\\'s profile.\\nHow much of a financial risk would this be?\\nThis is a time the sport cannot even attract a title sponsor for Super League - a situation branded unacceptable by the St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus, who cites his own club\\'s deal with tea-makers Typhoo as proof that the sport can pull in the blue-chip brands.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nKoukash clearly has cash and he wants to be able to spend it. But not every club is in a position to chase success in this way.\\nMorley suggests there should be a loophole introduced to have two or three \"star name\" players paid as much as you like outside of the salary cap.\\nKoukash added: \"There should be a mechanism in the sport to allow certain scenarios, clubs or situations to go and spend above the cap.\"\\nThe man who made his millions from racehorses clearly feels he will be unable to attract rugby league\\'s thoroughbreds to Salford under the current guidelines.\\nSuch an argument is unlikely to be met with a huge nod of approval from the likes of Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington who has built his own successful business model on a strict sliding salary scale at the Super League champions.\\nThe bigger question of course is that of the sport\\'s profile in World Cup year. McManus says this is rugby league\\'s \"biggest single financial weakness\".\\nThis is not a question about allowing Salford to sign as many players as they want. It is about maximising the exposure of the sport to the world and reaping the financial rewards of that.\\nMcManus says the game\\'s governing body needs to take responsibility. \"No sponsor is not acceptable. Either from the club\\'s perspective or from that of the governing body,\" he said.\\n\"Someone has to be answerable for that. It is something none of us are happy with and someone needs to be accountable.\"\\nMcManus feels that if these weaknesses in the way the game is marketed are \"readily identified and dealt with\" then the game has never been in a stronger position to prosper and grow. Koukash will expect to be at the forefront of that.',\n",

At such a time, one has to look at the strategy, at refinements that need to be made, at efforts that need to be augmented, and I know that\\'s what\\'s going on right now.\"\\n1974: Graduates from West Point US military academy, joining the army\\n2007: Leads US troop surge during Iraq conflict\\n2008: Head of US Central Command\\n2010: Nato commander in Afghanistan\\nMid-2011: Leaves military to become CIA director\\nNovember 2012: Resigns over affair\\nAfter commanding international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Petraeus became head of the CIA but was forced to stand down in 2012, following revelations of an extra-marital affair.\\nSubsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge.\\nBut despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America\\'s controversial military operations of recent years.\\nHe was the architect of the \"surge\" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level.\\nHe also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda.\\nNot surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill.\\nThe keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step.\\n\"You cannot deal with an industrial-strength extremist problem just with force of arms,\" he said.  \"You have to have that political component as well.\"\\nPolitical change has to start at the top. Above all, Gen Petraeus says, \"the Sunni Arabs have to be given incentives to support the new Iraq rather than to oppose it\".\\nAs to the fundamental question - can the Iraqi military actually win against Islamic State? - he has few doubts.\\n\"During the surge and in the years after the surge, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country at vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know that they can fight,\" he insists.\\n\"We know that they will fight. But they will only fight if they have good leadership, and the support and knowledge that somebody will have their back if they get into a tough fight.\"\\nThat looks like requiring greater US involvement closer to the frontline. Gen Petraeus is reluctant to give details.\\n\"Should there be US advisors with Iraqi forces below the divisional  level?\" he asks. \"Should there be joint teams of tactical air controllers on the ground with security and other assets to support them?\\n\"Does there need to be an augmentation of the train-and-equip effort?

And, most importantly, are our military elements and structures sufficiently supporting the political component and vice versa?\"\\nIn response to my comment that all this could have been said a year ago - Gen Petraeus responded by saying that he did indeed say it all a year ago. This is not about re-inventing the wheel.\\n\"We need to see the same elements of this (previous) comprehensive civil-military counter- insurgency campaign, albeit today with the Iraqis playing the key roles, enabled by the Americans.\"\\nGen Petraeus acknowledges the difficulties of grappling with the horrors in Syria but insists that the only way forward is to train and equip moderate opposition elements. He says that more such fighters will spring up once the programme gets under way.\\nAnd he is very cautious about any Iranian role in combating IS. He insists Iran remains a revolutionary power in the region.\\n\"This is a country that has made progress because of chaos. It has both benefited from chaos and fomented chaos to try to achieve regional hegemony,\" he says.\\nSo he believes that \"while there can indeed be some coincidence of interest between the US, its coalition allies in the region and Iran in terms of the defeat of IS (...) the over-arching context is one that gives you reason to have considerable caution in how you go forward in the relationship with Iran\".\\nGen Petraeus still travels to Iraq regularly. He knows the key players well. And though out of uniform and established in a civilian career as an adviser, he remains the man who did achieve a kind of success in Iraq.\\nThat is a commodity that is in short supply today for the Americans and the Iraqi authorities. This  makes the Petraeus approach an attractive model.\\nBut the question remains: Can the outcome be the same with the Iraqi military cast in the role of the Americans?',\n",

Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.\\nCarrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.\\nEyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.\\nFaizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news.

This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify.\\nMeanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed.\\nThe rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers.\\nThe latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research.\\nThe government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the \"most thorough research there has ever been\" in this area.\\nThe report itself notes that it is based on \"incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions\", but it says the estimates are the \"best that can be made at present\", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been \"completely honest about what they do know and what they don\\'t know\".\\nThe government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue.\\nIt has already announced a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise £200m a year.\\nA cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK.\\nMeanwhile, \"deliberate health tourism\" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between £60m and £80m a year. The report\\'s authors concede this figure is \"uncertain\" and the \"plausible range\" of the cost is £20m-£100m.\\nFrequent visitors \"taking advantage\" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further £50m-£200m a year, the report adds.\\nThe government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the \"conservative\" £500m figure.\\nTo achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks.\\nFree NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so.\\nAsylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment.\\nThe UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care.\\nThe NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just £73m a year is recouped out of more than £460m at present.\\nThis is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care.\\nShadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \"We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment.\"\\nBut he added the figures were based on a \"large number of assumptions\" and was more about \"spin than substance\".\\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association\\'s GPs committee, said the government\\'s £500m savings figure was \"exaggerated\", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans.\\nHe said migrants paying the proposed £200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to \"get their money\\'s worth\", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than £200.\\nDr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments.\\nDr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a \"new border agency\" in policing the NHS.\\n\"The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments,\" she said.\\nJonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been \"hugely overstated\" and was in fact a \"very small part of NHS expenditure\".',\n",

       " 'Prof Les Mayhew said the difference between the sexes peaked at nearly six years in the 1970s.\\nLife expectancy is going up all round, but the rates for men are increasing faster.\\nPlummeting smoking rates in men are thought to explain a lot of the change.\\nProf Mayhew, a professor of statistics at Cass Business School, analysed life expectancy data in England and Wales. He was working out how long 30-year-olds could expect to live.\\nHis findings show men languishing far behind for decades, but now starting to get closer to women. If current trends continue, Prof Mayhew predicts, both sexes could, on average, be living to the age of 87 in 2030.\\nHe said: \"What\\'s interesting at the moment is that in the last 20 years or so, male life expectancy at 30 has jumped by about six years and if it jumps by the same amount in the next 20 years it will converge with female life expectancy.\"\\nThe reason could be down to men living a healthier lifestyle. \"One of the main reasons, I think, is the trend in the prevalence of smoking. Smoking took off after 1920 in the male population and at its high about 80% of males smoked.\\n\"This was reflected in more divergence in the life expectancy, so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expectancy was about 5.7 years.\"\\nOther factors are thought to be safer, more office-based, jobs. Millions of men used to work in hazardous occupations such as coal mining. Healthcare has meant more men live longer as well. People with heart disease, which is more common in men, can expect to live much longer than they did a few decades ago.\\nBy contrast, women started smoking later than men.  \\n, but are falling fast in men.\\nA boy and a girl born on the same day will still not have the same life expectancies, as the study looked only at people who had already reached 30. Boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents.\\nIt means that women could still have the edge for some time to come.\\nProf David Leon, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"In virtually all countries in the world, women do have a slight advantage.\"\\nHowever, he said the gap was definitely closing in some countries.\\nCountries with lower levels of life expectancy, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, showed very little difference between the genders. This was due to the prevalence of infectious diseases which \"are not picky about men and women\", he said.\\nIn countries that had defeated most infectious diseases, such as in Eastern Europe, \"there is a much bigger difference, mostly dominated by lifestyle factors\".\\nAt one point in the 1990s, the gap between life expectancies in Russia reached 13 years. Prof Leon said it was an \"absolutely massive\" difference in a \"very gendered society\".\\nIn his third class of countries, such as the UK, the gap in life expectancies is starting to narrow.\\nHe said: \"Men are getting a bit better behaved and women are adopting male life expectancies.\"',\n",

It is now between 6% and 7%.\\nMore manageable than the heady days of seven years ago, yes, but there are fears that a lack of economic reform could see growth fall to 5% as President Xi Jinping balances the drive for a more efficient economy (with all the dislocating restructuring costs and possible job losses that could incur) with the need to keep political tension to a minimum.\\nIn a jittery world, China\\'s debt mountain can loom larger than the fundamentals suggest.\\nAnd Moody\\'s downgrade is just one straw in the wind.\\nAsian stock markets hardly paused for breath when it was announced earlier this morning and warnings of a \"hard landing\" for the Chinese economy have been oft-predicted and not materialised.\\nBut, Chinese bond yields are rising as investors demand a higher risk premium for funding the government\\'s liabilities.\\nThere is no need to rush for the lifeboats yet.\\nHowever, it\\'s probably worth knowing where they are.',\n",

The more they play, the more they improve through experience of playing in the top league.\"\\nFrom next season, the Czech First League will be ranked nine places above Scotland in the Uefa coefficient rankings, with two teams qualifying for the Champions League qualifiers.\\nHowever, Fitzel admits a 16-team league does have its pitfalls and they could end up moving in the opposite direction.\\n\"Currently here in the Czech Republic we are discussing maybe having 10 or 12 teams playing each other four times,\" Fitzel said. \"At the moment we do not play enough games.\\n\"A 16-team league has allowed us to have a winter break of two-and-a-half months. We finish at the end of December and start again at the beginning of March. But it means we only play 14 games in spring and all the clubs are saying we should have more games.\\n\"In a smaller league, maybe there are more interesting games. We are looking at the ice hockey league, where right now they have play-offs and the stadia there is sold-out; even the relegation play-offs. That\\'s fantastic income for the clubs and the stadiums hold 13,000 - 15,000 people.\"\\nFitzel, like many in Europe, has looked on with interest at the Scottish game in the last few years. He says the 12-12-18 set-up that was proposed in 2013 was interesting, but feels clubs should listen to what the supporters want.\\n\"It\\'s an interesting idea,\" he added. \"It is something new, and I always feel if you don\\'t try it then you don\\'t know.\\n\"From my point of view it is interesting to play for relegation or promotion. It could be a long period of games.\\n\"It seems interesting, but the question is do the people want to see this?\\n\"If you have enough teams for a 16 top division, they don\\'t need to be equal. Obviously in Scotland you have two big teams, though now there is a problem with Rangers playing out-with the top tier, but still there is two or three dominant teams.\"',\n",

       " 'Biologists studied a group of Sydney octopuses off Australia\\'s east coast and observed a range of behaviour that may indicate complex social signalling.\\nOctopuses that stand tall, turn dark and spread their web in a \"Nosferatu pose\" are likely showing aggression.\\nConversely, octopuses may display a pale colour after losing a fight or when trying to avoid conflict.\\nIt was previously believed that octopuses were largely solitary creatures. Changes to body colour and other behaviour were interpreted as tactics to avoid predators.\\nBut Prof Peter Godfrey-Smith said the unique study, based on 53 hours of footage and published on Friday in the journal Current Biology, provided a novel perspective on octopus behaviour.\\n\"[An aggressive] octopus will turn very dark, stand in a way that accentuates its size and it will often seek to stand on a higher spot,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith, who co-authored the report, said.\\n\"Clearly the unusual stance is not a physiological response. It makes it look as big as it can possibly be, with its arms spread out below and the mantle, the back part of the animal, raised over the head.\\n\"The dark colour is produced in concert with those size-accentuating behaviours. There\\'s no particular physiological reason why darkness should be associated with aggression, but it does give the impression of a larger object.\"\\nThe researchers, based in Australia and the US, dubbed the stance the \"Nosferatu pose\", referring to the classic 1920s horror film, because the spread of the octopus\\'s web was reminiscent of a vampire\\'s cape.\\nOctopuses frequently turned pale while retreating from aggressors and also produced high-contrast patterns known as deimatic displays.\\nThe contrasting patterns were most frequently observed when octopuses were attempting to return to their den after they had been forced out, or in the presence of an aggressive individual.\\n\"Suppose there\\'s a large, aggressive guy there and you want to get back into our den, if you approach with a pale colour it could be interpreted as a non-confrontational behaviour,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith said.\\nThe study also found that two octopuses displaying dark colours were likely to fight if in close proximity, while a darker-coloured octopus was likely to stand its ground against a lighter-coloured octopus.\\nAnother cephalopod, the cuttlefish, shows a similar set of features, with aggressive males darkening their faces and paler males withdrawing from fights.\\nThe unusually high number of octopuses living together in the colony off Jervis Bay, south of Sydney, allowed a more in-depth observation of interactions than had previously been possible.\\nProf Godfrey-Smith\\'s co-author David Scheel and his students combed through 53 hours of footage and observed 186 interactions between the octopuses.\\nThis included the Nosferatu pose, along with reaching, grappling and mating.\\nWatching these long videos was \"much more exhausting than I expected\", Prof Godfrey Smith said.\\n\"Identifying an individual from minute to minute is very difficult, because they change colour and shape.\\n\"If the octopus wanders out of the frame, there\\'s not much you can do.\"',\n",

       " 'What did the court say?\\nUntil now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work.\\nOn Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day.\\nThe ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive.\\nI\\'m a care worker who travels to different patients\\' homes. Am I affected?\\nPossibly, yes.\\nEmployees who fall into the category loosely defined as \"mobile workers\" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected.\\nSimon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category.\\nAs many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC.\\nAnd some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds.\\nI travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office\\nThe ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says.\\nThere may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office.\\nI have to commute two hours every day to my office\\nFor those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the \"overwhelming majority\" in the UK.\\nI think I\\'m affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours?\\nThe ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account).\\nThat could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up.\\nIt could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum.\\n\"I think some employers will look at where they\\'re sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don\\'t want to eat into that working time that they have,\" Mr Tutton said.\\nWe have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges\\' ruling.\\nHere is a selection of their comments:\\nThis is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don\\'t get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don\\'t get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester\\nI am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that\\'s before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don\\'t know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge\\nI am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon\\nI currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I\\'m at my first site by 10am. It\\'s wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I\\'ve worked over 11 hours without a break and it\\'s a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow\\nI am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford\\nI\\'m a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our \"pickup\" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset\\nI am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley\\nI\\'m a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere.

He will go away happy and we will see a progression on what they did against Scotland over the next few games.\\nThe tactics were more route one, using the forwards.

They delivered that against Scotland.\\nEngland also probably had two clear-cut chances to score tries and they took both of them.\\nFrom that side it is all positives but I think Joseph will want to be in the game more.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nHis centre partner Owen Farrell wasn\\'t in the game that much either and full-back Mike Brown wasn\\'t his usual self. That will come but it is just going to take a bit of time.\\nI am not massively sold on the combination of Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly-half and inside centre. If you have two number 10s who are out-and-out number 10s then both of them are spending too much time organising the game rather than carrying the ball.\\nFarrell only carried the ball three times against Scotland and Joseph four. The midfield is not really functioning properly if that is happening. But at the same time, they linked up beautifully to put Jack Nowell in for a try.\\nI would prefer an out-and-out inside centre who can also be a ball player rather than a fly-half playing there. At the moment it is a stop gap for England.\\nI would prefer someone with a little bit more individual threat who can also do the distributing. Someone who is saying, \"I need to be in the game more\". Sometimes Farrell is trying to plan what England do and plot them around the pitch. George Ford needs to be doing that.\\nHenry Slade is your dream but he is injured. He would have been the answer without a question of a doubt. At the moment they are having to do what they can with limited resources.\\nEngland edged the breakdown in terms of numbers and in terms of actual turnovers.\\nThere are a lot of people in the England pack that can make turnovers with Dan Cole, Chris Robshaw, Joe Launchbury, James Haskell, Billy Vunipola and Mako Vunipola off the bench.\\nI do hope England don\\'t come up against an out-and-out specialist open-side flanker and get done again. We are not going to see that probably until we go to play Australia in the summer but it will be interesting to see what England do in the meantime.\\nWe still need to develop an out-and-out number seven. It will strengthen our game but someone has got to play well enough to keep knocking on the door.\\nI judge intensity on the speed of your ball coming out from rucks and how fast people are getting into position to carry again.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nEngland completely outworked Scotland in that respect. I also judge intensity on what a side does in defence - in terms of line speed in getting up to make a tackle.\\nIn the first half England were a bit off it but in the second half they were outstanding.

From that point of view I think Eddie will be very happy.\\nThe scorelines might be similar between England\\'s first game under Stuart Lancaster at Murrayfield in 2012 (a 13-6 victory) and this weekend but England had a lot more control this weekend.\\nAt the same time it can\\'t really be compared.

Arguably, the appalling effects of that first atomic strike - and the subsequent attack on Nagasaki - have played a large part in the determination to prevent the use of far more devastating weapons developed since.\\nBack then, the US was the only nation with \"the bomb\".\\nThe story since has been of the steady spread, the proliferation, of nuclear weapons: first to Russia, Britain, France and China - then to Israel (although never officially acknowledged), India, Pakistan, North Korea.\\nThe big powers seemed either unable or unwilling to prevent that spread except perhaps now - in the case of Iran.\\nAll sorts of conflicting signals are coming out of the international talks in Vienna meant to end all the hostility between the major world powers and Iran over its much disputed nuclear programme. There\\'s talk of both breakdown and possible breakthrough.\\nSo why is it judged so important to stop Iran?\\nI asked Sir John Sawers, chief British negotiator with Iran from 2003 to 2007, and after that the UK\\'s representative on the UN Security Council when sanctions against Iran were being decided.\\nHe said: \"If Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, then it would change the dynamic across the Middle East.\\n\"It would make them invulnerable to any response to their unacceptable behaviour in the region.\"\\nSir John told me: \"If there is an agreement then, first of all, it gives everyone much greater assurance that Iran is not going to make a break for nuclear weapons.\\n\"It opens the possibility of Iran and its Arab neighbours coming together and developing a more normal relationship.\\n\"At the moment, the Middle East is riven by disputes - many of them along Sunni-Shia lines - and if we can create a possibility whereby Saudis and Iranians can talk to one another and it is not driven by continuous hostility, then there is a possibility of creating a different sort of Middle East.\"\\nIt\\'s not just August 1945 which hangs heavy over the negotiations with Iran.\\nThe events of February 1979 in Iran itself, and everything which has followed, help explain the years of suspicion and outright hostility between Tehran and Washington which a nuclear deal could do so much to ease.\\nAyatollah Khomeini\\'s triumphant return to Tehran - on 1 February 1979 - from exile in Paris to take power as supreme leader of an Islamic Republic symbolises the moment when the US and its allies lost control of Iran with the fall of the shah.\\nThe years of blatant Western interference were over.\\nRuhollah Khomeini was born in Kohmeyn in central Iran.

There is an Iranian saying that the real negotiation only begins once the agreement is signed.\\n\"They will always come back for more. Even if we get an agreement - it doesn\\'t mean it is \\'peace in our time\\'.\"\\nSo suspicion on both sides remains strong.\\nWhatever happens in the next few days, building and then maintaining trust between Iran and the key world powers, particularly the US, is still the toughest of all the challenges.',\n",

For years, the official Burmese mantra has been that \"no foreigner can possibly understand Rakhine\\'s problems\".\\nNow Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has been tasked with taking a fresh look at the issues as head of nine-member commission. His report could just add to the mountain of papers written about Rakhine and the Rohingya, or it just might be a game-changer.\\nWill anyone help the Rohingya?\\nRohingya migrant crisis in 90 seconds\\nThe \\'abandoned\\' people in Myanmar\\'s election\\nAung San Suu Kyi where are you?\\nSo what\\'s Aung San Suu Kyi up to?\\nWell, first a cynical take. Next week the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw and in September Ms Suu Kyi will head to the United States for the UN General Assembly and talks with President Obama.\\nThe Nobel laureate was no doubt bracing herself for awkward questions about why she wasn\\'t doing more to help Myanmar\\'s Muslim minority and in particular the 800,000 or so Rohingya. Those questions can now be easily deflected with reference to this new commission.\\nBut there\\'s more at play than that. By setting up the commission, Ms Suu Kyi is signalling that she is open to new ideas, and doesn\\'t have all the answers.\\nKofi Annan may be 78 but, as you\\'d expect from a former UN secretary general, he\\'s his own man.\\nThe final report, due to be delivered by the end of August 2017, is likely to contain suggestions that many Burmese consider unpalatable.\\nAlmost certainly it will insist that the Rohingya\\'s basic human rights are respected, perhaps recommending that Myanmar offer them a better route to citizenship.\\nIn Myanmar\\'s current political climate it\\'s hard for Ms Suu Kyi to bring those ideas to the table. She\\'d be attacked not just by hardline Buddhists but many within her own party.\\nSo Kofi Annan and his report could be the \"Trojan Horse\" that brings this sort of proposal into the national debate.\\nThere are of course plenty of caveats.\\nProblems as deeply entrenched as those between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State will not be solved overnight. The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh.\\nAfter the violence of 2012, more than 100,000 Rohingya were forced from their homes into camps. In the years that have followed there\\'s been no real effort to help them return.\\nRakhine has become increasingly segregated, with some comparing it to South Africa\\'s apartheid. Things have become quieter but there\\'s been little reconciliation.\\nWhatever the commission ends up concluding, any move to give the Rohingya greater rights will be hugely controversial not just in Rakhine State but across the country.\\nVocal parts of the Buddhist community are openly hostile towards international aid agencies and the UN. They\\'re unlikely to welcome Kofi Annan\\'s team, no doubt anticipating the sort of recommendations he might make.\\nImplementing any \"solution\" will be even harder.\\nBut the formation of this advisory commission is something new.

I'll be told before practice that this is what we're doing, I'll give a bit of feedback about what I might want to focus on, and we'll start work.\\nI'm the number two player in the world by a decent distance in terms of ranking points, so I'm not playing badly, but the goals remain the same as ever.\\nThere are still things I feel I can improve upon, which I need to do if I want to get to number one in the world and try and win majors.\\nI believe that Ivan, along with the other guys I'm working with, can help me achieve that.\\nI think my team is very strong right now.

       " 'Media playback is not supported on this device\\nNow, he has to find a replacement for the German as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton. And at this late stage of the year, it will be no easy task.\\nSo who will be on Wolff\\'s shortlist and how likely are they to get the seat?\\nThis is the fight many would like to see. Hamilton and Alonso are regarded as the two towering talents of their generation and their intense battle as McLaren team-mates in 2007 was cut short by Alonso falling out with boss Ron Dennis and leaving the team. They ended that year tied on points, one behind world champion Kimi Raikkonen, with four wins each.\\nRound two would be the biggest box office F1 could hope for, but it is highly unlikely to happen for two reasons: 1) Alonso is under contract to McLaren and even if he has a break clause - which they say he does not - they would not want to let him go; 2) More importantly, Wolff knows that the problems he had with Hamilton and Rosberg would pale compared to the potential difficulties of handling Hamilton and Alonso.\\nChances of it happening: 6/10\\nThe Australian was the choice of many observers as the driver of 2016, and Wolff is a big fan. The on-track battle with Hamilton would be intense, but Ricciardo is a laid-back character and would probably be easier to handle off it.\\nBut he is under contract to Red Bull until 2018. Red Bull says they have no intention of letting him go, but if Wolff approached them there is just the possibility that they may consider selling Ricciardo. Why? Because most accept that, long term, Ricciardo and Max Verstappen is not a sustainable line-up - if Red Bull become title contenders their relationship is very likely to become incendiary.\\nChances: 6/10\\nVerstappen is the big rising star of F1. Shaded by Ricciardo over 2016 as a whole, performances such as his stunning drive in the wet in Brazil last month mark him out as a future world champion.\\nWolff would be very interested but, like Ricciardo, Verstappen is under contract to Red Bull - in his case to the end of 2019. And Red Bull are even more in love with the Dutchman than they are with Ricciardo.\\nChances: 4/10\\nVettel\\'s love affair with Ferrari - and vice versa - is long over after a difficult and disappointing season. Relations with team boss Maurizio Arrivabene are frayed - especially since the Italian said the four-time champion should focus more on his driving and needed to \"earn\" a new contract beyond 2017. And Vettel was unhappy with the decision to split with technical director James Allison in the summer.\\nLikewise, Ferrari have been confused how, after a year and a half of easily beating team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, Vettel\\'s form slipped in the second half of 2016 - although they might want to read the previous paragraph for an answer.\\nVettel has been shopping around for a move and would almost certainly welcome a switch to Mercedes. But there are some problems: 1) his contract runs to the end of 2017 and there is no obvious replacement for Ferrari; 2) he might not fancy going up against Hamilton; 3) Vettel and Hamilton together is almost as much of a recipe for trouble as Hamilton and Alonso.\\nChances of it happening: 8/10\\nWolff has a long relationship with Bottas as part of his management team and rates him highly. The Finn has impressed in the last four seasons with Williams and would be a low-maintenance choice. He would deliver solid results on track and is calm and would not rock the boat off it.\\nNext year is the last year of his contract at Williams. The team is not the most flush with cash in the pit lane and Wolff would almost certainly be able to put together an attractive deal - either for a cash payment to release Bottas or a reduction in Williams\\' engine fee.\\nBut Williams have an 18-year-old rookie in the well-resourced Canadian Lance Stroll in their other car next year and need experience in the lead car. Wolff could offer them Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein, who raced for Manor in 2016, in exchange. But would Williams accept? Felipe Nasr, who raced for Sauber in 2016, would also be an option for them, and please F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, who needs a Brazilian in the sport to satisfy its largest single TV audience.\\nChances: 9/10\\nThe German is the obvious choice - he is Mercedes\\' reserve driver, he has tested for the team several times, and he is a free agent. But he has only one season\\'s race experience, and although he has put in some promising drives, he has had a few shaky ones as well.\\nPutting him in a race-winning car with Hamilton as his team-mate would be a big ask. And that\\'s without even considering his personality. Insiders say Wehrlein can be difficult and self-centred, and Wolff will be wary of putting such a character alongside Hamilton.\\nChances: 8/10\\nAnother Mercedes young driver, Ocon has impressed in his half-season alongside Wehrlein at Manor - so much so that Force India picked him rather than the German as their second driver alongside Sergio Perez for 2017.\\nBut Ocon has only nine races under his belt and it\\'s surely too early for him to get a seat at the factory Mercedes team.\\nChances: 7/10\\nA left-field choice, the Scot has been out of F1 for two years now. But he was Williams reserve driver this year and is a Mercedes-contracted driver in the DTM German Touring Car Championship and would be a solid option.\\nChances: 5/10\\nButton has retired from F1, but remains contracted to McLaren. He made it very clear in the last few weeks that he needed a break from the sport.\\nChances: 1/10\\nThe German has just signed a three-year deal with Renault, but the French company and Mercedes have links on a corporate level and Wolff is close friends with their racing boss Frederic Vasseur.\\nBut taking Hulkenberg would leave Renault with a vacancy that would be tough to fill and Wolff is not overly enamoured with him either.\\nChances: 2/10',\n",

It would apply to those with less than six months to live.\\nTwo doctors would have to independently confirm the patient was terminally ill and had reached their own, informed decision to die.\\nSome 110 peers are already listed to speak when the House of Lords debates the private members bill on Friday.\\nInsisting it would not be \"anti-Christian\" to change the law, Lord Carey said the current situation risked \"undermining the principle of human concern which should lie at the heart of our society\".\\nHe added: \"Today we face a central paradox. In strictly observing the sanctity of life, the Church could now actually be promoting anguish and pain, the very opposite of a Christian message of hope.\"\\nWhen Lord Carey was still the Archbishop of Canterbury he was among the opponents of Lord Joffe\\'s Assisting Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, which was successfully blocked in the House of Lords in 2006.\\nBut in his article in Saturday\\'s Daily Mail Lord Carey said: \"The fact is that I have changed my mind. The old philosophical certainties have collapsed in the face of the reality of needless suffering.\"\\nHe said it was the case of Tony Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome and died after being refused the legal right to die , who had had the \"deepest influence\" on his decision.\\nMr Nicklinson\\'s widow Jane, said Lord Carey\\'s switch was \"huge\".\\n\"I\\'m amazed actually and thrilled because the Church has always been one of our greatest opponents,\" she told BBC Radio 5 live.\\n\"Someone shouldn\\'t be forced to stay alive with daily suffering - his life was a living hell.\"\\nThere\\'s been something of a shocked reaction to what Lord Carey said. Let\\'s remember he\\'s a former archbishop. He still has some influence in the Church, especially among the more traditionalist minded Anglicans.\\nSo what he said really will have some consequences. He\\'ll also have some influence presumably in the House of Lords, having argued in the past strongly against similar legislation.\\nOne of the most telling things about what Lord Carey has said is that he now thinks it\\'s not \"un-Christian\" to allow people to take their own lives when they\\'re suffering at the end of their lives.\\nIt speaks to a body of people, including in the Anglican church, who now feel they can to some extent re-interpret what it is to be Christian, to be Anglican and how to put that into practice in their everyday lives.\\nTo hear that coming from a stalwart defender of biblical truth like Lord Carey is pretty significant.\\nLord Falconer told BBC Radio 5 live that Lord Carey \"makes the point that it\\'s not anti-Christian to support the change in the law that my bill proposes\".\\n\"I believe it reflects the view of almost everyone in the debate that - whatever view you take about the issues - nobody wants people who are properly motivated by compassion to be prosecuted. And he puts those arguments incredibly powerfully.\"\\nHowever, the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned Lord Falconer\\'s bill would mean elderly and disabled people coming under pressure to end their lives.\\n\"What sort of society would we be creating if we were to allow this sword of Damocles to hang over the head of every vulnerable, terminally-ill person in the country?\" he wrote in the Times.\\n\"It would be very naive to think that many of the elderly people who are abused and neglected each year, as well as many severely disabled individuals, would not be put under pressure to end their lives if assisted suicide were permitted by law.\\n\"It would be equally naive to believe, as the Assisted Dying Bill suggests, that such pressure could be recognised in every instance by doctors given the task of assessing requests for assisted suicide.\\n\"Abuse, coercion and intimidation can be slow instruments in the hands of the unscrupulous, creating pressure on vulnerable people who are encouraged to \\'do the decent thing\\'.\"\\nThe 1961 Suicide Act makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales. Anyone doing so could face up to 14 years in prison.\\nThe law is almost identical in Northern Ireland. There is no specific law on assisted suicide in Scotland, creating some uncertainty, although in theory someone could be prosecuted under homicide legislation.\\nThere have already been several attempts to legalise assisted dying, but these have been rejected.\\nThe Commission on Assisted Dying, established and funded by campaigners who have been calling for a change in the law, concluded in 2012 that there was a \"strong case\" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill in England and Wales.\\nBut the medical profession and disability rights groups, among others, argue that the law should not be changed because it is there to protect the vulnerable in society.\\nIn other countries, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, legislation has been introduced to allow assisted dying. France is considering a possible introduction of similar legislation, although there is opposition from its medical ethics council.\\nCampaign group Dignity in Dying predicts that a lot more countries will follow suit.\\nThe Bishop of Carlisle, the Right Reverend James Newcome, said Lord Carey\\'s comments would not influence any vote by bishops in the House of Lords.\\n\"The general synod has debated it and come to a conclusion. That\\'s the position to which we\\'re sticking.\"\\nBut Lord Carey did received support from Rabbi Jonathan Romain, an inter-faith leader for campaign group Dignity in Dying.\\nHe said the experience in the US state of Oregon - where assisted dying became legal in 1997 - showed \"very few people\" would use the right to get help to end their lives.\\nThe Church of England said in a statement that its governing body, the General Synod, had passed a motion on the issue in February 2012.\\nThe motion reaffirmed the Church\\'s \"support for the current law on assisted suicide as a means of contributing to a just and compassionate society in which vulnerable people are protected\".\\nAnd Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is the Speaker\\'s chaplain in the House of Commons, said having an assisted suicide law would sanitise death.\\n\"I just happen to believe that matters of life and death in that way is not for us to play with. There are lots and lots of vulnerable people out there... you cannot make a law that is going to have a serious impact on a majority of people.\"\\nDr Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship said he was concerned about vulnerable people being exploited.\\n\"We\\'ve got to think about the people who are going to feel a duty to end their lives so as not to be a burden to others.\\n\"I\\'m worried about the disabled people, the depressed and elderly, who are going to be put at danger by this bill which really just has eligibility criteria and not safeguards.\"',\n",

Not over-worked, but Celtic had a number of other chances. Not the worst.\\nIn second-half, he came more to life in terms of getting forward, which is a big part of his game.\\nIn team for his height and domination but didn't dominate his opponent or take responsibility for closing gap between defence and midfield. Use of the ball was poor.\\nProbably his poorest performance for Aberdeen - uncertain, played too deep. He didn't close down James Forrest quickly enough for the second goal and conceded the penalty for the third. Must be disappointed, because he's looked good since coming to the club\\nWasn't exposed on too many occasions against Patrick Roberts. Did have the chance with a header and maybe should have done better with it. Moved to centre-back later, his preferred his position. Didn't play to the standard he's capable of.\\nNot the worst in midfield. Tried hard but played in an area that was dominated by Celtic. Only got close to Celtic's midfielders on a couple of occasions and should have made it more difficult for them.\\nAn opportunity as captain to lift the trophy. He normally gives you an element of control in midfield but didn't do that. The gap between him and his defence was too wide, allowing Roberts, Rogic and Forrest to get in behind.\\nLargely anonymous in the first-half. Spent his time worrying about defensive duties rather than what he's good at. Turned it around in second half and had a number of good runs, but he's a match winner and he didn't show what he was capable of.\\nCeltic dominated in midfield and McLean must take responsibility. He's been at the club long enough to know what's expected, should be performing to a high level and on the big stage. If you want to be an international, you have to perform better.\\nWhenever he got on the ball, you felt, if anything was going to happen creatively, it was going to come through him. He was taken out the game on two or three occasions and Celtic players realised he was the main threat.\\nNot the Adam Rooney I know. Didn't do much in terms of causing a threat to the two centre-backs, who handled him extremely well. He needed to work harder to make it difficult for them but had little support. Should be a goal threat but didn't do that.\\nWon a couple of headers, but his timing was out at times after coming on for O'Connor.\\nExpect more from a player like him. With Hayes, who he replaced, he's the quality in terms of creativity and didn't create anything.\\nBarely touched the ball after taking over from Rooney. Hard when coming on at 3-0 down.\\nHad that save from Andrew Considine's first-half header but didn't have much else to do. To force his way back into the side and win a medal, you have to give him great credit.\\nFairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively.\\nWas probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout.\\nStrong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure.\\nAttacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target.\\nMan of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes. Led by example.\\nSolid display, worked very hard, not over-spectacular and should have scored at the end after getting himself into a great position.\\nAlways capable of doing something in the game. An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal.\\nScored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before, could he step up? And I think he did.\\nProbably Celtic's quietest player. Wasn't involved as much as he would have wanted to be.\\nProbably the quietest we've seen him but still scored his goal.

       " 'His wife Marina can still recall the last time she saw him. He was smiling in what she recalls was a sad way. She said she would be back tomorrow.\\n\"He suddenly just said \\'I love you so much\\',\" she remembers.\\n\"I said \\'Yes, of course. I love you too\\'.\"\\nBut when she got home, she received a call from the hospital telling her to rush back in. She did not get the chance to speak to him again.\\nAs he lay dying in his hospital bed, Alexander Litvinenko had remained the trained operative he had always been and tried to recall for police every detail that might hold a clue to his poisoning.\\nFor the police, he was something unique - a living murder victim - a man who was going to die but had time to talk to them.\\nSo who did he hold responsible for the mysterious illness which was taking such a terrible toll on his body? \"Everything that happened to him and he was able to speak - able to sign - he said Putin was responsible for his death,\" his widow told the BBC.\\nThe public inquiry will examine the central question - who was responsible for what was described by a lawyer in a previous hearing as \\'an act of state sponsored nuclear terrorism on the streets of London\\'?\\nIt was one of the most remarkable and sensitive murder cases in modern times.\\n\"This inquiry was different from any other investigation that I\\'ve ever been involved in,\" says Peter Clarke, who at the time ran the Metropolitan Police Counter-Terrorism Command which handled the investigation.\\n\"It was not only a murder inquiry but there were other key areas that we had to think about: public safety - over 40 sites of radioactive contamination in public places, on public transport, aircraft, offices, restaurants... And then there are the international dimensions, the diplomatic dimensions and the intelligence areas that came into this inquiry.\"\\nMuch is already known about the broad brush of events - that Alexander Litvinenko was killed by radioactive Polonium 210 and that two Russians, Alexander Lugovoi and Dimitri Kovtun, are believed by police to be responsible.\\nThey are believed to have administered the substance in a cup of tea at the Millennium Hotel\\'s Pine Bar  in central London.  Both men, though, have denied any involvement.\\nThis inquiry may reveal new details of the trail of evidence, though - a radioactive trail which shows that the Pine Bar may have been the third attempt to kill Litvinenko.\\nBut one issue never publicly examined is that of motivation. Why was Litvinenko killed? And crucially - was it on the orders of the Russian state? That is one subject this inquiry will be looking at.\\nLitvinenko was a former FSB officer who had become a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin, first in Russia and then in Britain where he eventually received citizenship.\\nThe inquiry was formally created in July 2014 after the government finally relented in the face of pressure from Marina Litvinenko and Sir Robert Owen, a judge then sitting as coroner but now chairman of the inquiry.\\nThe inquest process had hit a major problem - the government had demanded that certain material be kept secret but there is no provision for that in an inquest.\\nSo both Marina Litvinenko and Sir Robert argued that the inquest should be converted into a public inquiry in which material can be considered in closed session. The government at first resisted but Marina Litvinenko persisted with legal challenges even as her money began to run out.\\nIn July the government changed its stance. This was seen in some quarters as a reaction to worsening relations with Moscow.\\nIn the past there was suspicion that there was a desire to put the Litvinenko case to bed and get back to business but by last summer the crisis over Ukraine had changed Britain\\'s perspectives on Russia and may have led to the decision to hold an inquiry which could look at the issue of state responsibility.\\nAt a pre-inquest hearing, lawyers for the inquiry said that the material in possession of the British government did establish a \\'prima facie case\\' for the culpability of the Russian state in the death. But this may well be secret intelligence which will not come out in public evidence.\\nOne thing the inquiry will be unlikely to look at in open session is Alexander Litvinenko\\'s relationship with MI6.\\nAt one hearing, a lawyer for the widow of Alexander Litvinenko said that her husband had carried out work for MI6 and had a dedicated handler or case-officer with the pseudonym of Martin.\\nThis, the lawyer argued, meant that the inquest needed to look at whether the British state failed in its duty of care to Alexander Litvinenko by failing to take sufficient steps to protect him - in other words, could it have prevented the murder? In the end that issue was ruled out of the final inquiry.\\nIt has been a long journey. I first interviewed Marina soon after her husband\\'s murder when she showed a determination to uncover the truth.\\nSpeaking to her eight years on, she remains as firm as ever in that pursuit and still has confidence in the ability of the British justice system to deliver final answers, despite all the ups and downs on the way.\\nThe next few months will be the final test of that.',\n",

The original plan spared it but the new project runs over it instead.\\nRio City Hall said it was in talks with the owner of a local football ground to provide a new pitch.\\nThere were also concerns that those moving to the new social housing would lose the community feel they enjoyed in Vila Uniao.\\n\"I grew up in the community with my parents and four brothers,\" Mr Soares said.\\n\"There\\'s a market, a bank, a school. But the place where the families are moving to doesn\\'t have any of this.

Ageing is a nuclear safety issue\".\\nAs part of that ageing process the licensee was required to monitor and inspect the reactors regularly.\\nSteve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: \"It doesn\\'t feel good when we come up against limits and the first thing they [the ONR] do is to move the goalposts.\"\\nMr Foy stressed that the ONR was a \"robust regulator\" and due process had been followed.\\n\"If we feel the evidence they [EDF] have supplied is robust and sufficient to underpin the 8% case then we will agree it,\" he said.\\nThe graphite bricks are integral to UK nuclear power stations and they act to moderate the nuclear reaction; it will not function without them.\\nThe bricks cannot be replaced which means they are being carefully monitored as the reactors age. They become damaged through years of intense bombardment by radiation and effects of the coolant CO2 on the material.\\nA distortion to the graphite core could prevent the control rods being inserted, which shut down the reactor in an emergency.\\nEDF said \"safety of the public and our employees is our overriding priority\" and the company took a \"cautious approach\" working closely with the regulator and they operated with \"very conservative safety margins\" and safety requirements were \"stringent\".\\nBut in shifting the graphite limit Dungeness can still run only until the start of 2020 but that is still three years fewer than EDF would like and it may have to request a second increase in the safety limit.\\nProf Paul Mummery, from Manchester University, agreed that the original limits were \"conservative.\"\\nBut he said the twin problems of graphite cracking and weight loss meant it may be \"uneconomic\" for EDF to keep all the 14 AGR reactors running in the long term because the regulator may insist on more inspections to demonstrate safety.\\n\"They [EDF] are making good progress but I would not be able to say with absolute confidence that they will reach 2023,\" he said.\\nIt was an \"engineering judgement\", he said, but \"no one could be sure\".\\n\"There was more weight loss than expected in Dungeness B and that has led to some uncertainty about the continued operation.\"\\nThe AGR reactors contribute about 15% of Britain\\'s electricity, according to Prof Thomas.\\nHe said EDF wanted the old AGR reactors to last until the planned next generation of nuclear power stations came on line after 2023 but said it was reaching a \"crunch point\".\\nThe old reactors might not last as long as EDF would like and there were still real doubts about the plans to build the new reactor at Hinkley C in Somerset.',\n",

In fact the total expenditure on academies amounted to £8.3bn - £1bn over budget.\\nThe £1bn includes £350m paid to local authorities for temporary continued funding of places at non-academy schools, effectively double funding places while academies were being set up.\\nThe report says that to fund the expansion and remain within overall spending limits, the DfE had to find the money from other budgets, including the main schools settlement.\\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said: \"We make no apology for the fact that more schools than even we imagined have opted to convert, and no apology for spending money on a programme that is proven to drive up standards and make long-term school improvements.\\n\"We want as many schools as possible to take advantage of the significant benefits academy status brings because it means more schools run by great heads and teachers, not local authority or Whitehall bureaucrats, and more children getting a first-class education.\\n\"The Department for Education has made significant savings in the last two and a half years and also set aside significant contingencies which have been set against the growth in academies.\\n\"Additionally, the costs of converting academies have already fallen by 53% per academy. We anticipate further changes we are making will radically reduce costs in 2013-14 and beyond.\"\\nMargaret Hodge MP, chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: \"The decision to change fundamentally the nature of the programme away from one solely directed at struggling schools is up to the government, but taxpayers have the right to expect a more considered and controlled approach to public spending than the department has so far displayed.\"\\nShadow education secretary Stephen Twigg called for greater scrutiny, oversight and local accountability \"to ensure school standards improve and the taxpayer gets value for money\".\\nThe figures also drew criticism from teaching unions with Mary Bousted, of the Association and Teachers and Lecturers, saying they showed \"only too clearly that the expansion of academies is being driven by political ideology and not by what\\'s best for children\\'s education\".\\nChristine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"It is absurd for the government to justify spending £8.3bn on academy conversions in two years while at the same time warning of a dire economic situation. Meanwhile, many good state schools are told there\\'s no money as they stand in a state of disrepair with ever-diminishing support services.\"',\n",

That would push him right up the list for Ryder Cup qualification. Then there\\'s the matter of next week\\'s Open at Troon.\\nCurrently 27th in the world rankings, 131 places above the nearest Scot, Richie Ramsay, Knox is Scotland\\'s best hope to at least fight for these trophies.\\nHe is a contender in most tournaments these days, primarily on the PGA Tour, and for a place in Darren Clarke\\'s Ryder Cup team.\\nAs his star rises, Knox remains adamant that playing in front of an expectant home crowd over the next two weeks won\\'t be a hindrance, despite heightened expectation.\\nHis demeanour backs that up. He seems philosophical - what will be, will be.\\n\"It adds a little bit of pressure,\" he said. \"We\\'re used to it, every week you\\'ve got pressure. I put a lot of pressure on myself every time I play so I don\\'t really feel added pressure.\\n\"I\\'ve been wanting to do this my whole life. I\\'ve been wanting to play on the PGA tour, European Tour, all the majors and hey, it\\'s starting to happen.\\n\"I\\'ve been wanting to win tournaments, be in the top 20, 10 in the world, see how high I can get.\\n\"This is what I\\'ve been dreaming my whole life. I\\'m not sure if you\\'re ever really ready for it but you\\'ve just got to do your best and go for it.\"\\nThere\\'s a wider goal for Knox than doing well in his home country, or even achieving a dream Ryder Cup place.\\nGetting into the top 20 or 30 players in the world is tremendously hard. Staying there is just as difficult, if not more challenging, and plenty of players have been there and fallen away.\\n\"Of course the goal is to stay inside the top 50 but you have to play well to do that,\" said Knox.\\n\"It\\'s so hard to stay there. To be honest I don\\'t know how I\\'m going to do. I could quite easily move forward or quite easily move back.\\n\"That\\'s the hard thing about golf. It\\'s such a hard game. One week you feel like you can hit any shot, then up comes a week like last week when you\\'re like \\'Am I even good enough to play golf?\\' I feel like I can keep improving.\"\\nLuke Donald addressed us shortly before Knox\\'s arrival. He won this tournament at Castle Stuart in a rain-shortened Scottish Open in 2011, when he was the top-ranked golfer on the planet.\\nHe is now 83rd in the world and struggles to get anywhere near the form he showed so consistently.\\n\"Luke is a great player, and he\\'s just one example of someone who has been at the top and slipped down,\" said Knox. \"He\\'s still a great player.\\n\"It\\'s so hard to stay there and this is really my first go at trying to stay there and trying to move up.\"\\nSuch awareness can only be a positive for Knox and perhaps helps to keep his head on the ground despite his success.\\n\"The whole journey\\'s been crazy the last couple of years. I just hope I never wake up and it keeps going.\"\\nVictory here at home could be the launchpad for his life to get even crazier.',\n",

       " 'The device, which the company is calling Spectacles, will go on sale later this year priced at $130 (£100).\\nThe glasses will record up to 30 seconds of video at a time.\\nAs part of the announcement, Snapchat is renaming itself Snap, Inc.\\nThe renaming decision underlined the company’s apparent ambition to go beyond the ephemeral messaging app, a product which is highly popular with young people.\\nAn article published by the Wall Street Journal on Friday showed Snap’s 26-year-old creator Evan Spiegel in a series of pictures taken by  fashion legend Karl Lagerfeld.\\nIn an interview, Mr Spiegel explained his rationale for creating Spectacles.\\n\"It was our first vacation, and we went to [Californian state park] Big Sur for a day or two. We were walking through the woods, stepping over logs, looking up at the beautiful trees.\\n\"And when I got the footage back and watched it, I could see my own memory, through my own eyes - it was unbelievable.\\n\"It’s one thing to see images of an experience you had, but it’s another thing to have an experience of the experience. It was the closest I’d ever come to feeling like I was there again.\"\\nOn Saturday, Snap released some limited information about how the glasses will work.\\nFootage will be recorded in a new, circular format which can be viewed in any orientation, the company said. The battery on the device will last about a day.\\nA light on the front of the device will indicate to people nearby when the glasses are recording.\\nPrior to confirmation from Snap about the product, news website Business Insider published a promotional video it found on YouTube showing the product. The video has since been taken down.\\nBroken Glass\\nSpectacles will remind many of Google Glass, an ill-fated attempt by the search giant to create smart glasses.\\nWhile Google Glass did get into the hands of developers around the world - at a cost of $1,500 each - the device never came close to being a consumer product. The company eventually halted development, but insisted the idea was not dead.\\nThough Glass was beset by hardware issues, perhaps its main flaw was the public perception. At worst, many saw it as troubling, privacy-invading technology. At best, others just considered it ridiculous-looking.\\nHowever, with a far lower price point, and likely adoption by influential celebrities, Snap’s Spectacles stand a solid chance of being seen as cooler than Google’s attempt.\\n\"If you look at the kinds of glasses millennials wear, the design is very ‘in’,\" suggested Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst from Creative Strategies.\\n\"Making them sunglasses helps hide the camera better, but it also limits the usage somewhat - you’ll need to be outside in daylight.\\nShe added: \"The name change is interesting as it would indicate a change in focus away from messaging, which with Spectacles makes sense. Snap is perhaps becoming more about life-logging, content generation and story-telling.\"\\nAccording to the WSJ, Snap is not treating the device as a major hardware launch, rather a fun toy that will have limited distribution.\\n\"We’re going to take a slow approach to rolling them out,” Mr Spiegel told the newspaper.\\n“It’s about us figuring out if it fits into people’s lives and seeing how they like it.\"\\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook',\n",

You\\'ve got to find the resources, the facilities and the people,\" he told the BBC.\\nHowever, Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for firearms, said last month that the majority of new armed officers will be in place by April 2017.\\nThe latest announcement comes after 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice in the south of France last month.\\nLondoners and tourists out enjoying the August sunshine in central London report mixed feelings about more armed police patrolling the city\\'s streets.\\nTeacher Julie Banks, who was visiting from Liverpool, says she finds the news reassuring, \"especially at this time of year when there are more tourists and crowds.

It's a feeling that never gets old and we will be going to Wembley before Saturday so that those new to it can get a feel of the iconic 90,000-seat stadium.\\nIn attempting to win Chelsea's first piece of silverware, it's the biggest game in the club's history, but one thing I've been telling them is we have to play the game and not the occasion.\\nI wouldn't care if it was being played in a local park in Wembley, the most important thing is to win.\\nWith Chelsea's men's team also playing at Wembley the following day when the Premier League champions take on FA Cup winners Arsenal in the Community Shield, we want to make it a historic weekend.\\nThere are many players in our team who have won the FA Cup before, including myself.\\nThe first time was in 2005 with Charlton when I scored the winner against Everton and in 2012 I was part of the Birmingham team which beat Chelsea on penalties following a 2-2 draw.\\nIn our dressing room we have midfielder Katie Chapman, who has won the FA Cup eight times, and Gilly Flaherty, who has won it five times, so we are not lacking pedigree.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nBut having missed out on WSL so narrowly last season [on goal difference to Liverpool], it's fair to say that this could mean more because of the journey we have been on together.\\nDespite losing our last two league games, we aren't panicking. We have strong characters in the dressing room and the belief that got us to the FA Cup final and saw us go unbeaten in 13 matches this year.\\nThere has been plenty of talk about the fact that our unbeaten start to the league season has come to an end.\\nIt would have been nice to hold onto that record, but the WSL is a very competitive league and every team in it has dropped points. We were the last to do so. We didn't play well in a 4-0 loss at Sunderland but the promoted side are now top of the league and our defeat by Manchester City last Sunday came courtesy of a very fortunate winner. Despite the result, our performance was pleasing.\\nWe are a point off the top with five games left and to be in that position in such a competitive season is positive.\\nOur focus is now on Saturday and we are confident we can win.\\nAnother positive from the World Cup has been the boost to crowds in the WSL.\\nThe first weekend after we arrived back saw record numbers for Manchester City, while 2,061 watched Liverpool beat Arsenal, and more than 1,200 saw us beat Bristol.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nThree weeks after our return, the bounce has lasted. Our first home defeat in more than 18 months by Manchester City was watched by a club-record 1,857 at Staines FC.\\nThose numbers are a credit to marketing staff at WSL clubs and the players, who are obviously putting on a good show in order to entice supporters back. The time we spend with fans immediately after games also helps too, I think.\\nThe test now comes when the Premier League starts on 8 August.\\nWith the Continental Cup now under way again, our season doesn't end until October, so hopefully the upsurge in attendances will continue and women's football will still very much be something people want to watch.\\nEngland and Chelsea forward Eniola Aluko was speaking to BBC Sport's Alistair Magowan.\",\n",

       " 'But the overall national picture for GCSE grades is very similar to last year. The proportion getting A* to C grades has nudged up from 68.8% to 69%.\\nThat represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries. But the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top A* and A grades - is that there is \"stability\".\\nThis isn\\'t an accident. The annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate.\\nIt\\'s more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be.\\nWell, perhaps that\\'s not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature.\\nThe huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn\\'t be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils.\\nAdd to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards.\\nHead teachers\\' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results.\\nHe has warned of \"volatility\", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective.\\n\"It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,\" said Mr Lightman.\\nThe lingering question is if one year\\'s results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades?\\nOfqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system.\\nBut it\\'s a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems.\\nOnce there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same.\\nAnother factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam.\\nThis year\\'s nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort.\\nThere are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt.\\nAnd another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds.\\nBut if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales.\\nNorthern Ireland\\'s pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in Wales.\\nNot only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72%.\\nEngland\\'s education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead.\\nWhen these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else.\\nThe scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4% achieve A* grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5%.\\nIn England, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest A* grades.\\nThis sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places.\\nWhether or not it is going to be consolation for England\\'s school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible.\\nBecause in a couple of years England\\'s GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland.\\nAnother curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers\\' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term?\\nIt would take another exam to answer that one.',\n",

       " 'As Iraq lurches deeper into turmoil and disintegration, Kurdish leaders in the already autonomous north are threatening to break away and declare outright independence.\\nAnd the militants of the self-styled Islamic State (IS), bulldozing the border between Iraq and Syria in June 2014, declared their intention to eradicate all the region\\'s frontiers and lay Sykes-Picot to rest forever.\\nWhatever the fate of IS, the future as unitary states of both Syria and Iraq - central to the Sykes-Picot project - is up in the air.\\nIn fact, virtually none of the Middle East\\'s present-day frontiers were actually delineated in the document concluded on 16 May 1916 by British and French diplomats Mark Sykes and Francois Georges-Picot.\\nThe Iraq-Syria border post histrionically erased by IS was probably several hundred kilometres from the famous \"line in the sand\" drawn by Sykes and Picot, which ran almost directly from the Persian border in the north-east, down between Mosul and Kirkuk and across the desert towards the Mediterranean, veering northwards to loop around the top end of Palestine.\\nThe region\\'s current borders emerged from a long and complex process of treaties, conferences, deals and conflicts that followed the break-up of the Ottoman Empire and the end of World War One.\\nBut the spirit of Sykes-Picot, dominated by the interests and ruthless ambitions of the two main competing colonial powers, prevailed during that process and through the coming decades, to the Suez crisis of 1956 and even beyond.\\nBecause it inaugurated that era, and epitomised the concept of clandestine colonial carve-ups, Sykes-Picot has become the label for the whole era in which outside powers imposed their will, drew borders and installed client local leaderships, playing divide-and-rule with the \"natives\", and beggar-my-neighbour with their colonial rivals.\\nThe resulting order inherited by the Middle East of the day sees a variety of states whose borders were generally drawn with little regard for ethnic, tribal, religious or linguistic considerations.\\nOften a patchwork of minorities, there is a natural tendency for such countries to fall apart unless held together by the iron grip of a strongman or a powerful central government.\\nThe irony is that the two most potent forces explicitly assailing the Sykes-Picot legacy are at each other\\'s throats: the militants of IS, and the Kurds in the north of both Iraq and Syria.\\nIn both countries, the Kurds have proven the Western coalition\\'s most effective allies in combating IS, although the two sides share a determination to redraw the map.\\n\"It\\'s not just me that\\'s saying it, the fact is that Sykes-Picot has failed, it\\'s over,\" said the president of Iraq\\'s autonomous Kurdistan Region, Massoud Barzani, in a BBC interview.\\n\"There has to be a new formula for the region. I\\'m very optimistic that within this new formula, the Kurds will achieve their historic demand and right [to independence]\".\\n\"We have passed through bitter experiences since the formation of the Iraqi state after World War One. We tried to preserve the unity of Iraq, but we are not responsible for its fragmentation - it\\'s the others who broke it up.\\n\"We don\\'t want to be part of the chaos and problems which surround Iraq from all sides.\"\\nPresident Barzani said the drive for independence was very serious, and that preparations were going ahead \"full steam\".\\nHe said the first step should be \"serious negotiations\" with the central government in Baghdad to reach an understanding and a solution, towards what Kurdish leaders are optimistically calling an \"amicable separation\".\\nIf that did not produce results, he said, the Kurds should go ahead unilaterally with a referendum on independence.\\n\"It\\'s a necessary step, because all the previous attempts and experiments failed. If current conditions aren\\'t helpful for independence, there are no circumstances which favour not demanding this right.\"\\nIraq\\'s Kurds are landlocked and surrounded by neighbours - Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq itself - which have traditionally quashed Kurdish aspirations.\\nUnder threat from IS, they are more dependent than ever on Western powers which are also strongly counselling them to stick with Iraq.\\nBut whether or not the Iraqi Kurds achieve full formal independence in the near future, they have already established an entity with borders, a flag, international airports, a parliament and government, and its own security forces - everything except a passport and their own currency.\\nTo that extent, they have already redrawn the map. And next door in northern Syria, their fellow Kurds are essentially doing the same, controlling and running large swathes of land along the Turkish border under the title of \"self-administration\".\\nAs for IS, its territorial gains have already peaked. But the chaos in both Iraq and Syria that allowed it to take root have yet to run their course - the alienation of Iraq\\'s Sunni Arab minority (and the Kurds), and Syria\\'s fragmentation in a vicious sectarian civil war.\\nThe unspoken struggle is over whether formulas can be found for different communities to live together within the borders bequeathed by 20th Century history, or whether new frontiers will have to be drawn to accommodate those peoples - however that concept is defined.\\n\"Sykes-Picot is finished, that\\'s for sure, but everything is now up in the air, and it will be a long time before it becomes clear what the result will be,\" said the veteran Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt.\\nThe Sykes-Picot agreement conflicted directly with pledges of freedom given by the British to the Arabs in exchange for their support against the collapsing Ottomans.\\nIt also collided with the vision of the US President Woodrow Wilson, who preached self-determination for the peoples subjugated by the Ottoman Empire.\\nHis foreign policy adviser Edward House was later informed of the agreement by UK Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, who 18 months on was to put his name to a declaration which was to have an even more fateful impact on the region.\\nHouse wrote: \"It is all bad and I told Balfour so.

I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually.\\nOn top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself.\\nThe influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power.\\nIn relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for £1m, why would there be another £1m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football.\\nJonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group\\nAgents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one.\\nPeople get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter.\\nHowever, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football.\\nWe get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly.\\nStoke City chairman Peter Coates\\nFootball clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised.\\nI wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5%, 10% or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get.\\nThere are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it. All clubs do their best, obviously we don't want to pay any more than we have to. But it's a tough market. They play the field, which they're entitled to, and it's not easy.\",\n",

       " 'I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blasé attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation.\\nHe is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web.\\nTo some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet.\\nTo others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted.\\nDingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues.\\nBut we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year\\'s Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas.\\nThe timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (£0.7bn) a year in revenue.\\nDingledine\\'s talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web.\\n\"I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" he tells me, \"where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article.\\n\"The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that\\'s been the story for a while - so they need a new story.\"\\nThe Tor Project\\'s website has a section called \"Abuse FAQ\".\\nIt is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes.\\nWhen talking about this, Dingledine invokes the \"guns don\\'t kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do.\\n\"I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they\\'re doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things.\\n\"It\\'s not like there\\'s a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\"\\nI guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online.\\n\"I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists.\\n\"Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There\\'s a lot of crime out there.\"\\nIn layman\\'s terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track.\\nThere have been rumours that law enforcement has \"cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid.\\n\"As far as I know, no, they haven\\'t [cracked Tor].\\n\"Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn\\'t mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\"\\nAny major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing.\\n\"Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects, \"Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\"\\nTor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden\\'s whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading \"Tor Stinks… but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: \"We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time.\"\\nGiven this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project\\'s inception in the nineties.\\nHe is confident that funding will continue.\\n\"A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\"\\nThe reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in.\\nIn 2014, Facebook\\'s London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month.\\n\"About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely,\" Dingledine says.\\n\"Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this \\'dark web\\' thing…. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase.\"\\nThe ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online.\\nBut given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor\\'s justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing.\\n\"I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries,\" he says.\\n___________\\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\\nYou can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370',\n",

       " 'Scotland\\'s early lead had gone, the sides were level at 1-1 and the frailties at the heart of their defence were evident again. \"It was a crisis,\" said the Scotland manager, earnestly.\\nCrisis was a strong word to use, but it was Strachan\\'s word and it was a revealing one. It spoke not just to the predicament his team were in against a nation ranked 176th in the world but also to Scotland\\'s previous opening days in major championship qualification.\\nThe 0-0 draw against Lithuania that got the Euro 2000 campaign off to a grim start. The 2-2 draw against the Faroes in the first round of matches for Euro 2004. The 0-0 draw with Slovenia in week one of the qualifiers for World Cup 2006.\\nThe loss to Macedonia on the first day of the campaign to make the World Cup in 2010. The draw with Lithuania that put Scotland on the back foot straight away in the Euro 2012 qualifiers. The draw with Serbia that did the same for World Cup 2014.\\nScotland failed to qualify for all those tournaments, as if anybody needs reminding.\\n\"Everybody was concerned,\" said Strachan, about half-time in Malta. \"But we had a bunch of lads who could deal with the stress.\"\\nScotland had enjoyed 72.5% possession in that opening half and their dominance of the ball wasn\\'t reflected in a dominance on the scoreboard.\\nThis is not unusual when teams play Malta, but it\\'s still unsettling at the time. Lots of possession doesn\\'t always mean lots of goals. Malta can be slapstick but, on their very best days, they can also be stuffy.\\nStrachan would have known that. Maybe that\\'s where the mention of a \"crisis\" came from, a realisation that while the minnows don\\'t win matches, they do have the capacity, from time to time, to frustrate.\\nIn the qualifiers for Euro 2016, Italy had 71% possession (and a one-man advantage for 46 minutes) against Malta and yet only scored once against them. In the return match, they had 70% possession and again they broke down their opponents only once.\\nIn the same group, Croatia had their issues with the Maltese. They, like Italy, had a one-man advantage, for 59 minutes, and enjoyed 70% of the ball but only scored twice, the second coming nine minutes from the end. In their second game with Malta, they had 64% possession and only won 1-0. Strachan had mentioned their stuffiness in the preamble. At half-time, that fear wouldn\\'t have been far from his mind.\\nIn fairness to them, Scotland picked up the banana skin and flung it out of their road. At 2-1, they had retaken control of the game, then they benefited from a horrific refereeing error that gave them a penalty they didn\\'t deserve, a decision that also unjustly reduced Malta to 10 men with half-an-hour left.\\nIn the Euro qualifiers, 10-man Malta managed to batten down the hatches against the 11 men of Italy and Croatia but they couldn\\'t repeat the trick against Scotland. Strachan\\'s team got seriously lucky with the penalty and the red card, but they made the most of it. Five goals is a hell of a return when so many would have settled for one, as long as it was decisive.\\nWhat did Sunday night tell us? It told us that Strachan\\'s favoured centre-halves, Russell Martin and Grant Hanley, had better start playing games for their clubs - they\\'re out of the picture at Norwich and Newcastle - before the next round of qualifiers in October. In a worrying opening half the pair of them were rusty and vulnerable, even to the pea-shooters of Malta.\\nIt told us that Ollie Burke has a lot to offer, that in James McArthur\\'s absence, Barry Bannan\\'s surprise selection was justified and that in Leigh Griffiths\\' absence - and the increasingly perplexing omission of Ross McCormack - Chris Martin scored an important goal to make it 2-1.\\nIt also told us that Matt Ritchie\\'s delivery from out wide could be invaluable. Above all, it reminded us that Robert Snodgrass is not just a terrific footballer, but he\\'s also a fine leader - and if there was luck involved in his hat-trick then it was not before time. Injury robbed him of 16 months of his career. The man is due some payback.\\nScotland\\'s record on the opening day of major championship qualifying campaigns is lamentable, but this team has spared itself the misery of its predecessors. They can look to Lithuania at Hampden on 8 October with a bit of confidence.\\nLike the Malta game, that\\'s a must-win. Lithuania drew 2-2 with Slovenia on Sunday having led 2-0 after 34 minutes. They\\'re already weakened by that result. Scotland can deal them a major blow by beating them next month. Prepare to forget about qualification if they don\\'t.\\nWe can only talk in ball-park numbers when trying to figure out how many points Scotland may need to make the play-offs - presuming that England, though hugely uninspired in victory against Slovakia, go on and win the group.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nFor the 2014 World Cup, Croatia, Iceland and France made the play-offs with 17 points. All the other nations that made the play-offs could have got there with 18, although some ended up with more than 18.\\nFour years earlier, and because Scotland\\'s group was so lamentably bad - Norway finished second with a feeble 10 points, 11 points would have got a team to the play-offs. That was a highly unusual campaign, though.\\nOver those past two World Cup qualifying campaigns the 16 teams that advanced to the play-offs had an average of 20 points each. That\\'s why home and away victories against Malta and Lithuania are vital. It\\'s why Slovakia and Slovenia need to be beaten at some stage, home or away. Even then, Scotland may need to garner some draws to top up their total.\\nScotland have been a mile off that standard. In the last three World Cup qualifying series they finished on 11 points (2014), 10 points (2010) and 13 points (2006).\\nScotland being Scotland, even when they got off to a flier (Euro 2008 campaign) and had nine points out of nine (including a win over France) and 12 points from a possible 15 at the start, they still didn\\'t make it. None of this will be easy, but it\\'s not supposed to be.\\nThe encouraging thing is that, on Sunday, they leaped over the first hurdle, an obstacle they usually thunder into before crashing to the floor. The barriers only get bigger from here. But, then, the prize, is pretty huge, too.',\n",

Two Chinese researchers demonstrated a photo-realistic talking head - type in some text and he\\'ll say anything you want, blinking and moving almost like a real person.\\nCraig Mundie says the success of Kinect, which racked up 8m sales in its first 60 days, is proof that the sheer scale of Microsoft\\'s R&D strategy is paying off.\\n\"Microsoft is at a point where many of the things that we\\'ve been researching for twenty years are starting to add up and produce solutions,\" he says. \"You can\\'t rely on two guys in a garage to make all the changes, some of these things require a huge amount of technology and a lot of scale.\"\\nBut Microsoft desperately needed a hit from its research labs.\\nEver since Bill Gates decided 20 years ago that the company would spend big bucks on trying to see into the future, there have been ideas aplenty but few stand out products. A decade ago, for instance, Gates was showing off tablet computers - but it took Apple and its iPad to make them mainstream.\\nPeter Lee, who runs the Redmond lab, says the research operation has a wide remit, from dealing with instant fixes to current products to blue-sky thinking.\\nProfessor Lee, who joined Microsoft last year after a distinguished academic career and a spell at the US defence agency DARPA, insists the labs are having an impact  on a daily basis.\\nHe cites the contribution to what he describes as the \"holy war in search\", the battle between Google and Microsoft\\'s Bing.\\n\"Hour by hour we have a large group of researchers actively involved in Bing, constantly adding new research advances into the product.\"\\nBut he thinks the long-term research is equally important.\\n\"Some call it navel-gazing, we call it pushing back the frontiers of human knowledge,\" he says with a smile, predicting that his lab will one day win a Nobel prize.\\nHis boss Craig Mundie is Microsoft\\'s big thinker, charting the path of its future research. His current obsession is what he calls natural user interfaces, new ways of interacting with computers, of which Kinect is one example.\\nThere is, he says, a shift about to happen from the old graphical user interface to a trend where \"the computer is more like us - it sees, it listens, it speaks, it understands, it even seeks to do things on our behalf.\"\\nIt is an intriguing vision, but here\\'s a sobering fact. All these clever ideas, smart people, and major investment have not stopped Microsoft from being overtaken in the last year in terms of market value by Apple, which seems to focus on the customer experience now, rather than five years down the line.\\nBig, sleepy, and dull, I suggested to Mr Mundie, is how many people now perceive Microsoft.\\n\"We don\\'t feel big and sleepy or dull,\" he responded, \"but if people perceive us that way I think looking at the stuff that Kinect brings should change that view.\"\\nAnd he insists that firms that do not have the patience to spend on long-term research will lose out in the end.\\n\"I don\\'t think any company is going to prevail over a long period of time in giving good business returns, if they aren\\'t making these kind of investments. They\\'ll come and go in a generation if they don\\'t have the staying power that\\'s produced by having real mastery of the underlying technologies.\"\\nMicrosoft, which still generates huge revenues from its core products, Windows and Office, can well afford to keep spending on its blue-sky thinking. But having made such a big bet on science, it will be hoping that the coming years will produce more Kinects, and fewer tablet PCs.',\n",

We then follow that carbon which has been fixed by the plant into the soil and into the microbes and back out of the soil.\"\\nHe added that the experiment would provide data on how novel crops, such as miscanthus, introduced carbon into the soil and how stable it was once it was in the ground.\\n\"As you can see, miscanthus is very different from anything you would see normally,\" he observed.\\n\"It originates from Asia and so there has not been a lot of work done on it and the carbon tracer approach is a very good way of seeing how much carbon fixed by the plant will stay in the soil a year later.\"\\nAnother experiment the team are carrying out involves taking a metre-deep soil sample, which co-researcher Rebecca Rowe describes as \"quite unusual\".\\n\"A lot of soil science, at the moment, is done to about 30cm, partly for practical reasons as coring to a metre is difficult,\" she said.\\nDigging deep\\nIn order to extract the metre-long sample, the team have to enlist the help of \"Kevin\", an adapted road-breaker.\\n\"Also because a lot of arable crops or grassland crops the rooting depths are much shallower, a lot of the changes are happening in the top 30cm,\" Dr Rowe told BBC News.\\n\"Obviously, with energy crops that are in the ground for 20-25 years, we are looking at a lot longer timescale and a greater depth for rooting so it is important for us to go deeper.\"\\nDr Rowe is 12 months into a three-year project that involves collecting metre soil samples all over the UK.\\n\"We could just do it here at our Lincolnshire site, but then we would only be able to say what is happening with soil carbon in this location in this soil type,\" she explained.\\n\"By going all over the country, we can look at different soil types and different climates - the South-West is very different  to, say, southern Scotland.\\n\"It gives us a much better idea of what the overall effect on soil carbon may be in all of the sites across the UK with growing things like willow, miscanthus and different arable crops as well.\"\\n(Source: UK Bioenergy Strategy)\\nDr McNamara said the data would be used to develop a model, developed by researchers from Aberdeen University and other partners, to show how growing bioenergy crops would affect an area of land\\'s soil carbon characteristics.\\n\"Our plan is to make a model universally available to the community, so a user could download our model and then - for example - predict what would happen if they converted their land to bioenergy crops in terms of the implication for soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said.\\nThe project - commissioned and funded by the Energy Technologies Institute, with additional funding from the Natural Environment Research Council - would, Dr McNamara added, help address the concern over the scarcity of data on bioenergy crops and carbon cycling, and allow policymakers make informed decisions about the role bioenergy can play in delivering a low carbon UK energy mix.',\n",

The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window.\\nBuilding societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete.\\nThe Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years.\\nMrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988.\\nThe new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme.

Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped.

British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later.\\nThis led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK.\\nOne of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986.\\nThe promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to \"tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at \"affordable\" prices.\\nAnyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid.\\nPrivatisation was key to the Thatcher government\\'s economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing.\\nIt also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies.\\nYet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s.\\nIn 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010.\\nBy Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News\\nThe impact of one of Margaret Thatcher\\'s deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK.\\nThe so-called \"Big Bang\", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange.\\nThe most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face.\\nBig Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading.\\nIt also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen\\'s club, ruled by restrictive practices.

One suggestion is raising health workers\\' salaries so that they stop accepting envelopes.\\nBut that alone will not be enough. Associate Professor Ta Van Binh, director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, believes that the government needs clear rules and tough punishments for medical staff who break them.\\nBut work also needs to be done to help patients understand that they do not need to give envelopes - and may themselves be breaking the rules if they do.\\nNguyen Huu Ngoc even thinks that there should be sanctions applied to patients who give envelopes to help clean up the industry.\\nBut this would need co-operation from all sides - patients, health workers and the authorities - and remains a big task.\\n\"It\\'s not an easy thing to do because corruption is about money, people and power,\" said Mr Davidsen of the World Bank.\\n\"It\\'s a huge challenge curbing corruption and co-ordinating anti-corruption efforts across government agencies.

This may be her 15th year on tour, but she has missed more time than most due to shoulder problems, as well as the ban. And rest did Roger Federer no harm before the Australian Open in Melbourne, when he clinched his 18th Grand Slam title after a six-month injury lay-off.\\nShe has won Slams on all surfaces and is brimming with motivation on her return from what she considers an unduly harsh ban imposed for an administrative error. And mentally, she is stronger than anyone bar Serena Williams.\\nBut it will probably take time. Stringing together seven wins in a row at a Grand Slam is notoriously difficult when you lack match practice and sharpness, and Sharapova may have to negotiate an extra three matches of qualifying at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.\\nThis was one of the main themes of her first news conference with regular tennis writers for 15 months.

That wouldn\\'t help her tennis, she pointed out. The locker room is where you go for an ice bath, she argued. Her true friends can be found away from the workplace.\\nSharapova would love to be at Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year, and she says she would be \"prepared to play in the juniors\" if it helped. She would need to reach the final here in Stuttgart to earn sufficient ranking points to gain direct entry into the qualifying draw of the French Open.\\nIf she fails to do so, her fate will be revealed to great fanfare on the evening of Tuesday 16 May, when wildcards for both qualifying and the main draw will be announced on Facebook Live.\\nThe All England Club is unlikely to go down the same route.\\nOfficially, wildcard recipients will not be determined until Tuesday 20 June, by which time Sharapova could be back in the top 100 and eligible for the main Wimbledon draw. To do so she will need to earn close to 600 ranking points from this week and her next two tournaments in Madrid and Rome.\\nA return of one semi-final and one quarter-final is likely to be enough, but that would still be some effort after so long away from the sport.',\n",

       " \"This is the full statement to the inquests from his niece, Ms Natalie Tennant, on behalf of his brother, Peter Copoc:\\nStephen Paul Copoc was born on 1 August 1968, and was aged 20 years when he died at Hillsborough.\\nStephen was the baby of our family, and the apple of our Mum's eye. Our family consisted of Mum and Dad, I, Peter, my sister Angela and then our Stephen. I was 10 years old when Stephen was born. Angela was just seven years old.\\nOur Dad took us to the hospital, so that we could meet our new baby brother. Mum and Dad said that Angela and I could name him, and we did. Financially, we had little, but our parents, Agnes and Harold, made sure that there was lots of love in our house.\\nStephen was such a joy to all of us. Mum and Dad only received good reports from Stephen's school regarding his conduct and application to his lessons.\\nProfiles of all those who died\\nStephen's personality was such that people warmed to him instantly as he had an easy way with him. He was popular with teachers and made friends, having the ability to also keep friends. The friends that he made when he was small were still his close friends when he died on that awful day.\\nWhen we moved from Garston to our new house in Speke, Stephen had no problems adapting to the new environment, getting to know our new neighbours and making friends in an effortless and  uncomplicated way.\\nI started work at 17. There was a shop in Garston called Smiths that sold everything. It's gone now. I bought Stephen a train set when I got paid. He was about nine at the time and wanted one.\\nAs Angela and I were so much older than him, we kind of spoilt him, as he was such a lovable kid. I remember us both setting up the train set together and the joy Stephen got playing with it.\\nHe was so careful about his toys. When he finished playing with the train set, he would put it away neatly. He minded his toys.\\nHe used to follow Angela everywhere, even if she was going out to meet friends he would follow her and she would complain to Mum and Dad about having to bring 11 him.\\nHowever, one day someone told Angela that there was an accident on the road and that Stephen was hurt. Angela ran down the cinder path near our home towards the school crying.\\nWhen she got there, she was told he had not waited for the lollipop lady and got a bump from a car. He was physically fine, but Angela was sobbing and so distressed at the thought that Stephen was hurt.\\nAngela was so good to Stephen and minded him throughout his childhood. All her friends knew him well because he was like her shadow.\\nStephen started to take an interest in birds when he was about 12 years old. He started to study them and could tell you the name of most birds as well as their  eggs. It was also around this time that he became interested in fishing.\\nWe had cousins that were avid fishermen and they took him along to Speke Hall, which is a rural setting in a National Trust estate right in the middle of Liverpool. He just loved fishing there and knew all about the fish that lived in the waters there.\\nHe seldom, if ever, brought fish home to Mum and Dad. It was a joke in our house about Stephen catching fish, but he preferred to put the fish back into the water.\\nWe think it was the birds and the fishing that started Stephen wanted to work out of doors. He appreciated being outdoors.\\nHe finished school at 16 years of age and studied for his City and Guilds in Botany and Horticulture. He could name any flower and plant and was perfectly at home with nature.\\nHe applied for and got a job with the Liverpool Parks and Gardens based in Calderstones Park. He treasured his job and became a gardener at Sudley Hall in Mossley Hill.\\nHe loved his work, the people he worked with, he enjoyed meeting all the visitors and telling them about the gardens.\\nWhen Stephen was about 15 years old, he met his girlfriend Jackie. They were very much in love and were engaged to be married when he died.\\nStephen knew what he wanted from life. He was very close to our Mum and his main ambition in life was to save enough money to buy our parents a house. He did not want them living in rented accommodation.\\nHe was mature and sensible for his age. He took out insurance policies in case anything happened to him, as he wanted our parents to have some money.\\nHe was very caring to his nieces and nephews. When Angela's marriage broke down and she was on her own with her two children, Sean and Carla, Stephen with his  girlfriend Jackie would babysit and play with the children, keeping them amused for hours.\\nHe could have been out with his mates but knew that Angela needed time alone and his family always came first with him.\\nStephen, of course, loved football. His love of football and of Liverpool came from our Dad. The whole family travelled around to watch the matches, but not since 1989.\\nAfter 1989, we gave the season tickets back and we never went to a football match again.\\nStephen loved to play football as well. He was not the best of players, but he was like an encyclopaedia when it came to anything about football generally.\\nStephen was a great music fan. He was always playing Pink Floyd and, in particular, 'Shine on you Crazy Diamond'. He always loved Marillion and went to concerts with his four close friends.\\nOur parents never got over Stephen's death and the way he died. Our brother Stephen was one of life's genuine nice guys.\\nOur Stephen was just 20 years of age, but had maturity and a caring attitude towards others and even from a young age carried a donor card.\\nWe miss Stephen from our family and think about what might have been for all of us as a family if Stephen had not died on that awful day. Thank you.\",\n",

       " 'That\\'s the conclusion of a study that suggests a fourfold rise in the amount of mineral and organic phosphorus needed on grasslands by 2050.\\nThe researchers say that at present, more phosphorus is being lost from soils than is being added by farmers.\\nBut there are concerns that increases in the use of the mineral could damage the environment.\\nPhosphorus is an irreplaceable element for all life forms - but it is only since the 19th century that humans have been systematically using it to boost agricultural production.\\nThe mineral can be mined as phosphate ore - but animal excrement is also an important source especially in the developing world.\\nDemand grew so rapidly over the 20th century that there were concerns about overuse and \"peak phosphorus\".\\nBut research published in 2012, looking at the need for phosphorus on crops, suggested that future demand could be met from existing sources.\\nThis new study though looks at the use of phosphorus on grasslands which cover around a quarter of the Earth\\'s ice-free land areas.\\nThese fields are crucial are in the production of milk and meat. As global incomes rise, demand for these products is set to soar. This in turn will spark a rise in demand grass crops and production is expected to increase by 80% by 2050.\\nBut the study points out that at present, the vast majority of grasslands in the world are losing more phosphorus than they are gaining.\\nThe losses are mainly caused by farmers collecting manure from grasslands and using it to fertilise croplands. The amount being lost from intensive farming is far greater than from pastoral systems. Between 1970 and 2005, 44% of these losses occurred in Asia.\\n\"This is one main factor,\" said Prof Martin van Ittersum, a co-author of the study from the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands.\\n\"Of all the manure that is deposited on the grassland, half of it is taken away for croplands or used for fuel or for plastering the walls of the houses in Africa.  The fact is that the grasslands are not fertilised, so you have very little inputs to the system.\"\\nThe researchers say that to meet the projected demand for grassland in 2050, the amounts of phosphorus used will have to grow more than fourfold from 2005 levels.\\nTo cope with both grassland and arable land demands, the overall use of mineral phosphorus fertiliser must double by the middle of the century.\\n\"It is a vast area but that is very significant, yes,\" said Prof van Ittersum.\\n\"It is our strong assumption, that productivity will decrease and the pressure on our feed crops will increase and that is something that we should avoid,\" he said.\\n\"There is already a societal concern that we are feeding too much of our cereal crops to livestock and that pressure will only increase if our grasslands decrease in productivity.\"\\nBut increasing the amount of phosphorus used on land, especially in mineral form, carries significant environmental concerns.\\nExcessive use of fertilisers of all types can lead to a leaching of nutrients into the sea where they have created so-called \"dead zones\".\\n\"A fourfold rise in phosphorus use would have a big impact on the environment, especially on marine life,\" said Marissa de Boer who is European Project Manager of SusPhos at VU University in Amsterdam.\\n\"The leaching of phosphorus from agricultural lands into rivers and eventually the sea leads to uncontrolled algae growth and dead zones such as the ones found in the Baltic Sea, Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico. This is an effect of increased fertilizer use in the past half century.\\nWhat would the effect be if we now increase phosphorus use fourfold?\"\\nProf van Ittersum says these issues can be controlled. The most important thing is awareness.\\n\"We are still talking about modest amounts, I don\\'t think the environmental risks are particularly big,\" he told BBC News.\\n\"We have to do it carefully, we have to reuse our residues and wastes and make sure as little phosphorus as possible ends up in our sewage systems.\"\\nThe study has been published in the journal, Nature Communications.\\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook.',\n",

They\\'re clinging to the belief that Scotland can garner enough points from a remaining available total of 18 to force their way into the reckoning when the evidence of everybody\\'s eyes tell us otherwise.\\nPresenting a scenario of Scotland reeling off win after win required a fair amount of chutzpah for an association that has watched its team concede seven goals in three winless games.

No acceptance that, if he\\'s staying on, he needs to have a major think about what he is doing, who\\'s he selecting and not selecting.\\nIf he had spoken about a new beginning then you might - might - be inclined to buy into it.

What happens when Kieran Tierney and Andrew Robertson are both fit at left-back, along with Lee Wallace and Stephen Kingsley? Is it really one from four there? Does it have to be that way?

Too often, Strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it\\'s done nothing for the team.\\nThe tired mantra that \"the players are just not there\" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that Scotland become truly competitive, like Northern Ireland. They have decent Premier League centre-halves - from West Brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from Southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth.\\nAnd yet, from a squad largely made up of Championship, League One and Scottish Premiership players, Northern Ireland get the kind of results that are beyond Scotland.\\nThe attitude of \"no manager could do better with these players\" is fatalism. It\\'s tantamount to a white flag being raised. A quitter\\'s charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what Michael O\\'Neill is doing with his meagre resources in Belfast.\\nThe SFA\\'s statement on Thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of Hampden. When they can\\'t get a draw against Georgia, can\\'t beat Lithuania and can\\'t avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like Slovakia, the idea of Scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell.\\nScotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.',\n",
       " 'Dubbed \"carbon farming\", researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects.\\nBut critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices.\\nThe research has been published in the journal Earth System Dynamics.\\nJatropha curcas is a plant that originated in Central America and is very well adapted to harsh conditions including extremely arid deserts.\\nIt is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world because its seeds can produce oil.\\nIn this study, German scientists showed that one hectare of jatropha could capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert.\\n\"The results are overwhelming,\" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart.\\n\"There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,\" he said.\\nAccording to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period.\\nThe scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas.\\nThey are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good,  short term solution to climate change.\\n\"I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing.\"\\nAccording to the scientist\\'s calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS).\\nA number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially.\\nGrowing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant\\'s seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return.\\n\"Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,\" said Prof Becker.\\nBut other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions.\\nLucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different.\\n\"When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,\" she said.\\n\"But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn\\'t class the land as marginal.\"\\nShe pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert.

       " 'Satellite images show colonies moving their locations in years when the thin sea ice on which they habitually breed forms late or is absent.\\nScientists report the observations in the online journal Plos One.\\nThey reveal the birds travelling long distances to find alternative sites.\\nThese are further in towards the coast, up on the ice shelves - the thick slabs of glacier ice that jut out over the ocean.\\nIt is a surprise because these shelves are frequently faced with cliffs that may be tens of metres high in places. But somehow, the emperors find a way up to breed, and also to come and go as they forage for the seafood that will sustain their chicks.\\n\"We thought that in years when the sea ice was bad, they just didn\\'t breed, but they\\'re clearly more adaptable than that,\" said lead author Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey.\\nThe emperor is the most southerly of the Antarctic penguin species and the only one to breed on sea ice in the southern winter.\\nTheir reliance on these thin seasonal marine floes as a reproductive platform, coupled with concern about how the patterns of Antarctic sea ice could change in a warming world, has led to the species being designated as \"near threatened\" on the IUCN red list.\\nCurrently, the extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing year by year, albeit slowly.\\nThe coverage does however vary considerably by region, and climate computer models indicate any gains will very likely be reversed later this century.\\nBut this study on four colonies around the continent suggests emperors do have the capacity to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead.\\nIn the observations of Shackleton Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, for example, the penguins are seen to be very adept at finding the routes that allow them to get past a 30m-high cliff.\\n\"When they go out from the colony to forage, they go down the steep cliff - the shortest route to the sea. We\\'re not sure how they get down - they may slide down or jump down,\" Mr Fretwell told BBC News.\\n\"But this cliff is too steep for them to climb back up and so they must return a different way, likely through an ice creek. This route is 5km longer and we know they take it because we can see their tracks in the satellite pictures.\"\\nThere is a big opportunity here to go study these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition.\\nThere is obviously some cost to going up on the ice shelves - they are windier and the birds must travel further to forage. If that cost was not there, they would habitually breed on the shelves rather than the temperamental thin floes.  But how big this cost is and how beneficial is the observed adaptation in years of poor sea ice has yet to be properly established.\\nCo-author Barbara Wienecke from the Australian Antarctic Division said: \"These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals. However, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations.\\n\"The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected.\\n\"We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions.\"\\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos',\n",

       " 'The finding deals a significant blow to the theory of physics known as supersymmetry.\\nMany researchers had hoped the LHC would have confirmed this by now.\\nSupersymmetry, or Susy, has gained popularity as a way to explain some of the inconsistencies in the traditional theory of subatomic physics known as the Standard Model.\\nThe new observation, reported at the Hadron Collider Physics conference in Kyoto and outlined in an as-yet unpublished paper, is not consistent with many of the most likely models of Susy.\\nProf Chris Parkes, who is the spokesperson for the UK participation in the LHCb experiment, told BBC News: \"Supersymmetry may not be dead but these latest results have certainly put it into hospital.\"\\nSupersymmetry theorises the existence of more massive versions of particles that have already been detected.\\nIf found, they might help explain the phenomenon known as dark matter. Galaxies appear to rotate faster at their edges than the matter we see can account for, and one set of candidates for this missing dark matter is supersymmetric particles.\\nHowever, researchers at the LHCb detector have dealt a serious blow to hopes of finding them.\\nThey have measured the decay between a particle known as a Bs meson into two particles known as muons. It is the first time that this decay has ever been observed, and the team has calculated that for every billion times that the Bs meson decays it only decays in this way three times.\\nIf superparticles were to exist, the decay would happen far more often. This experiment is one of the \"golden\" tests for supersymmetry, and it would appear that this hugely popular theory among physicists has failed.\\nThe result is at a statistical level of \"3.5 sigma\" - meaning that there is a one-in-4300 chance that the team would see the same \"bump\" in their data if the decay were not happening. This level makes the find worth further investigation, but falls well short of the 5-sigma level of certainty required for a formal discovery.\\nProf Val Gibson, leader of the Cambridge University LHCb team, said that the new result was \"putting our supersymmetry theory colleagues in a spin\".\\nThe results are in fact completely in line with what one would expect from the Standard Model. There is already concern that the LHCb\\'s sister detectors might have expected to have detected superparticles by now, yet none has been found so far.\\nIf supersymmetry is not an explanation for dark matter, then theorists will have to find alternative ideas to explain those inconsistencies in the Standard Model. So far researchers who are racing to find evidence of so called \"new physics\" have run into a series of dead ends.\\n\"If new physics exists, then it is hiding very well behind the Standard Model,\" commented Cambridge physicist Dr Marc-Olivier Bettler, a member of the analysis team.\\nThe result does not rule out the possibility that super particles exist. But according to Prof Parkes, \"they are running out of places to hide\".\\nSupporters of supersymmetry, however, such as Prof John Ellis of King\\'s College London, said that the observation is \"quite consistent with supersymmetry\".\\n\"In fact,\" he said, \"(it) was actually expected in (some) supersymmetric models.  I certainly won\\'t lose any sleep over the result.\"\\n• The Standard Model is the simplest set of ingredients - elementary particles - needed to make up the world we see in the heavens and in the laboratory\\n• Quarks combine together to make, for example, the proton and neutron - which make up the nuclei of atoms today - though more exotic combinations were around in the Universe\\'s early days\\n• Leptons come in charged and uncharged versions; electrons - the most familiar charged lepton - together with quarks make up all the matter we can see; the uncharged leptons are neutrinos, which rarely interact with matter\\n• The \"force carriers\" are particles whose movements are observed as familiar forces such as those behind electricity and light (electromagnetism) and radioactive decay (the weak nuclear force)\\n• The Higgs boson came about because although the Standard Model holds together neatly, nothing requires the particles to have mass; for a fuller theory, the Higgs - or something else - must fill in that gap\\nFollow Pallab on Twitter',\n",

We gave Bin Laden his jihad.\"\\nLady Manningham-Buller said MI5 was given a budget increase after 9/11 and again in 2002 but the agency still needed far greater resources as a result of the Iraq invasion.\\n\"By 2003 I found it necessary to ask the prime minister for a doubling of our budget,\" she said. \"This is unheard of, certainly unheard of today, but he and the Treasury and the chancellor accepted that, because I was able to demonstrate the scale of the problem that we were confronted by.\"\\nBaroness Manningham-Buller was part of the government\\'s Joint Intelligence Committee before the war, which drew up the controversial dossier on Iraq\\'s alleged weapons of mass destruction in September 2002.

On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down.\\nThe themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall.\\nThe 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later?\\nI haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure.\\nI read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad.\\nGiven that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round?\\nLike with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth.\\nDoes having a black cast give the play a new perspective?\\nIt certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US.\\nBut it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family.\\nYou took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve?\\nI'm just at the beginning. The past three years have been great and we are starting to achieve some of things we set out to do. It's great that we get do do All My Sons, and we get to work with the companies like the  National Theatre as we did last year with Moon on a Rainbow Shawl.\\nWe've got a writers' programme working with the Bush and Soho Theatres and the BBC, and we have a space we are desperate to develop into a 100-seat venue. We are looking for funding to do that.\\nWhat's the latest on workshops you've had with Lenny Henry on a play about the American comedian Richard Pryor?\\nWe are still in the workshopping process.

By the middle of the previous century, most of the lowland areas, particularly in south Wales, were under English control, in the form of Anglo-Norman barons from the Marches and across Glamorganshire to Pembroke.\\nGwynedd and the north-west of Wales remained largely independent. Welsh princes acknowledged the ruler Llywelyn the Great and his successor Llywelyn ap Gruffudd as the overarching Prince of Wales. But as the century wore away, and Edward I of England came to power, the balance of power changed as Llywelyn refused to pay tribute to Edward.\\nIn 1276 Edward I led an invasion into Gwynedd and forced Llywelyn into the very top corner of the country, and set about his castle-building programme. An uprising in 1282 led to renewed fighting, and saw the death of Llywelyn. By the following year it was over, and English domination over Wales was entrenched. Edward\\'s son, the future Edward II, was created Prince of Wales.\\nAt the start of the 1200s, Welsh was the language of the common people.\\nIt was how people did business, conducted family life and worshipped. By the end of the century, daily business was increasingly done in English.\\nEnglish settlers were encouraged to move to Wales by free land grants and the imposition of English law.\\nAs the settlers moved into the more fruitful lowlands, Welsh speakers were increasingly pushed to the higher ground, although there was crossover between the two.\\nOne of the main changes through the course of the 13th Century was the difference in the way people paid for things.\\nAccording to Dr Mark Redknap, head of collections and research in the history department at the Museum of Welsh Life, the old system of \"render\" was starting to change.\\n\"It\\'s fair to say that from about the end of the 13th Century the Welsh were more familiar with using money than they had been a century earlier,\" he said.\\n\"You had an increasing use of coinage whereas there is very much a barter economy with the pre-Norman period, and payment in kind.\"\\nHe said taxes to the English king were paid in cash. Coinage though was still more at the stage where the actual weight of the coins, in silver for example, was what provided the value rather than a nominal amount printed on the coin.\\nAs well as tithes paid to the church, Llywelyn had tried to levy tax on cattle and in lieu of military service.

I have regained strength and feel motivated.\\n\"It has not been easy to find work after the ruling but I am not complaining. The tunnel is nearing its end.\"\\nHe entered that tunnel in 1990 when his contract with RFC Liege expired. With the club in financial trouble they wanted the midfielder to sign a new deal on a quarter of his former salary.\\nYet when Dunkerque, across the border in France, wanted to buy him, Liege demanded four times what they\\'d paid for him in the first place.\\n\"It was illogical,\" said Bosman, explaining the moment he decided to become a \"freedom fighter\".\\nHis lawyer thought it would take two weeks. It took five years; a period that should have been the best years of a decent career.\\nBanned in Belgium, Bosman moved to a second division club in France, only for them to go bust. Other clubs told him they would like to sign him but could not because they already had three foreigners.\\nHe had a brief spell on the island of La Reunion and another go in the Belgian leagues, but it is an understatement to say his decision to take football\\'s business model to court made him less attractive to club chairmen.\\nBroke, tired and out of shape, he accepted 350,000 Swiss francs in damages for his legal victory and began a life after football that he is still trying to work out.\\nThere was a disastrous investment in a t-shirt business (he had hoped grateful footballers would buy one, only his lawyer\\'s son did so) and problems with the taxman.\\nIn 2011, he was convicted of assault following claims he had been involved in an argument with his girlfriend after he asked her daughter to get him some booze.  Initially, the courts were lenient but when he failed to pay his fine they were left with little choice. He was sentenced to a year in prison in 2013.\\nIt was then that Fifpro, the international trade union for footballers, stepped in. The stars he had helped become multi-millionaires may have forgotten him but his union did not.\\n\"I was young and handsome then and I now have become old,\" he explained.\\n\"Most of the players won\\'t be able to recognise me but my case is still being talked about - I think that is positive.\\n\"I may not be here in 20 years\\' time but they will still be talking about it and if someone remembers me I will give him my bank details. Everyone benefited from the Bosman ruling except me!\"\\nI am speaking to him at Fifpro\\'s swish headquarters in a suburb of Amsterdam. Bosman has become a spokesman for the organisation\\'s campaign to finish what he started: scrap transfer fees entirely.\\nThe best way to understand this is to view Bosman as a battle in a 125-year war between clubs and players.\\nThe players won Bosman but were \"ambushed\", in the words of Fifpro\\'s general secretary Theo van Seggelen, six years later. The European Commission made a deal with the game\\'s governing bodies, Uefa and Fifa, to stem what the clubs claimed was rampant \"player power\".\\nThis deal was enshrined in Fifa\\'s Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players in 2001.\\nThese rules set out today\\'s transfer system - windows - the concept of a protected period when a contract cannot be broken, maximum and minimum contract lengths and so on - and for Fifpro they amount to the pendulum swinging towards the clubs.\\nFive years later, a row about Scottish defender Andy Webster\\'s move from Hearts to Wigan Athletic saw that pendulum swing back.\\nThe details of the case are convoluted but the final ruling seemed to fix what compensation a player/new employer should pay the old employer for breaking a contract outside of the protected period. This sum would be the wages the player would earn if he stayed.\\nThis really could have been revolutionary but two years later the Court of Arbitration for Sport changed the compensation equation by adding pro rata slices of the initial transfer fee and an estimate of the player\\'s replacement cost.\\nPlayers such Andrea Pirlo or Robert Lewandowski could still let their contracts expire to get Bosman moves to new teams and bigger wages. But clubs wanting to sign players still under contract, even outside the protected period, would have to cough up some compensation, as Manchester City did with Raheem Sterling last summer.\\nQuite right too, is the usual response to this compromise between a player\\'s right to ply his trade on the one hand, and a club\\'s right to stability and a league\\'s competitive integrity on the other.\\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez, the first Spanish player to get a Bosman to England, has criticised the transfer window, but does not want to scrap compensation.\\n\"The Bosman ruling was a huge shock at the time but I used it and it now seems a normal way to move freely,\" said Martinez last week.\\n\"Football has benefited from the multicultural input of players and it seems normal now.\\n\"But it wouldn\\'t be right to scrap transfer fees. The value of a footballer is important and the value of developing players is important.\"\\nBut Fifpro\\'s Van Seggelen says this view is based on a misunderstanding of the players\\' position, as well as being unfounded in truth.\\nDr Stefan Szymanski, author of the best-selling Soccernomics and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, did some research for Fifpro earlier this year which outlined how the system was failing to do any of the things it promised in 2001.\\nAccording to Szymanski, the settlement has led to the rich clubs getting richer as more than half of all transfer spending circulates among them, with little trickling down the pyramid, far less than is syphoned off by agents.\\nHe also outlined how the same clubs and leagues keep winning, while the same types of clubs and leagues keep failing, leaving themselves, he says, vulnerable to match-fixing, third-party ownership and the trafficking of minors.\\n\"We thought the transfer system was finished on 15 December, 1995, but of course it isn\\'t,\" explained Van Seggelen.\\n\"In fact, the situation is even worse than before. I often say to people \\'how would you feel if you had to wait three months for your salary?\\'\\n\"You also have players waiting years for justice through the tribunal system, and even when he has a positive decision there is no enforcement system. We cannot accept that.\"\\nThat might win over a few more voters on the terraces but there will still be many in the \"Bosman ruined football\" camp who think this is simply a union fighting for more money for its members, and in this case the members are loaded.\\n\"Only 1% of our members are financially independent, so not every player is making that kind of money,\" said Van Seggelen.\\n\"We\\'re not trying to make them richer. In an ideal world, every player would play at the level they belong.\\n\"I don\\'t know why the clubs are so nervous. We are not trying to kill the top clubs or leagues.\\n\"Sport is unusual but it must be reasonable. It\\'s an economic activity, a business, so it must respect the law.\"\\nBy this point, Bosman is outside smoking.\\nDespite arriving late and looking like he could not wait for the interview to end, he was good company.\\nHe does not watch much football these days, he cannot afford the television subscriptions, but what he sees he enjoys.\\nHis main focus is looking after his two young boys and being a better dad to the grown-up daughter he has from an earlier relationship.\\n\"Martin and Samuel are too young to know about my case, I don\\'t want to complicate their lives with it, they\\'ve just left kindergarten,\" he said.\\n\"But I think later, when they grow up, they could find out about what their dad has done for professional players on the internet and they will see their dad has done something good.\\n\"Back then clubs were selling hens, horses, mules and pigs, but not humans.\\n\"Players should be considered as workers, full stop, that\\'s it!

But the US economy is recovering, underlined by recent data on consumer confidence, jobs, house prices and growth in manufacturing and services.\\nMs Yellen said the rate rise \"should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress that the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue\".\\nAlthough inflation is still below the Fed\\'s 2% target, it expects the rise in prices to pick up gradually over the medium term.\\n\"The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate,\" the Fed statement said.\\nIt added: \"The federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\"\\nThe Fed also published its economic forecasts for the next three years.\\nThese suggest that the Federal Funds rate may rise to 1.4% next year; 2.1% in 2018; and 2.9% in 2019.\\nGDP growth will rise to 2.1% next year and stay there, more or less, during those years.\\nThe unemployment rate will fall to 4.5% over the 2017-2019 period, the Fed forecast.\\nAnd inflation will rise to 1.9% next year and hover at that level for the next two years.\\nThe dollar rose 0.5% against the euro to â‚¬0.9455, and was 0.9% higher against the yen at 116.17 yen.\\nWall Street\\'s main stock markets were largely unmoved immediately after the Fed\\'s announcement, but drifted lower later. The Dows Jones index closed down 0.6%, and the S&P 500 was 0.8% lower.\\nThere\\'s a name missing from the Federal Reserve\\'s statement - Donald Trump. The president-elect\\'s surprise triumph at the polls last month has turned out to be a short term boost to the US economy.\\nStock markets have surged higher, and consumer confidence indicators show US consumers feeling even more upbeat. The challenge for the Fed is working out what his election may mean to the economy in the next year or so.\\nThe most obvious likely impact could come from tax cuts which both he and the Republican Congress seem to favour. Less certain is an infrastructure spending spree that Mr Trump would evidently like, but which many in Congress are less keen on.\\nIf Janet Yellen and her colleagues considered these political issues, they weren\\'t mentioned in the official statement on monetary policy. Nevertheless Mr Trump has a way of breaking in to most conversations these days.\\nAnd the first question asked of Ms Yellen at her press conference duly concerned America\\'s next president - and she admitted that Mr Trump\\'s impact on US tax and spending policies might have influenced some of her colleagues forecasts for next year.',\n",

       " 'This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people.  I got it like other people on our network.  The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos.  I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence.  I\\'ve been sleeping here most of the time since.\\nOur social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change.  It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks.\\nI like to think the social network is the people itself.  Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools.  When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it\\'s about people.  Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline.\\nThis is something that people dreamt of but didn\\'t anticipate happening in reality.  If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted.  It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square.\\nAt the moment I\\'m not getting a lot of internet connection.  I\\'m trying not to drain my phone battery. We\\'re still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we\\'ve sorted through.\\nI hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.  At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet.\\nTwitter: Amr Gharbeia\\nI was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I\\'ve now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I\\'d never been part of a demonstration on the ground.\\nAt first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn\\'t believe how it turned into something so different from what we\\'ve seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping.\\nNow I sometimes just tweet to update people about what\\'s going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I\\'m well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom.\\nBlogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it\\'s about time that we start to live like real people.\\nTwitter: Nawara Negm\\nI\\'m not writing my blog right now.  We\\'re just using Twitter as it\\'s easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square.\\nThe internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people\\'s anger.\\nIn the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we\\'re trying to set an example of how we can all live together.  It\\'s like a city inside the city here.  We are the kernel of the revolution.\\nBlog: MaLek X (in Arabic)\\nThe revolution was publicised on the internet.  The spark was Facebook.  People were really sceptical about it because they didn\\'t think you could have a revolution where you named the date, but now I look around me and I am really proud of the Egyptian people and the initiative.  I\\'m sure that those who named the date didn\\'t think things would go this far.\\nTo begin with on 25 January, we had mostly young people of all classes who somehow use the internet.  You have internet cafes even in the poorest areas of Egypt so even less well-educated people have access, especially to Facebook.  A lot was also achieved through word of mouth - people telling their friends and neighbours.  The independent media took a middle-ground to begin with as everyone was watching their backs but now they have got onboard.\\nAfter our huge turnout on the first Tuesday, demonstrations continued for the next two days and we publicised further action for Friday on the internet.  That day they cut our communications and took our cameras so we had an information blackout and the violence was unbelievable. A lot of people died.\\nStill the threshold of fear and pain had been broken and we have kept up momentum since. Now older people especially come up to us when we\\'re collecting trash or whatever in the square and they say: \"We\\'re really proud of you... You did what we didn\\'t manage to do for 60 years.\"\\nPeople have called this the \"Facebook Revolution\" because it gave us a form of expression even when people were too scared to talk in big groups about political issues.  We had already set up Facebook pages for people who were tortured to death.  We found it was a way to talk without being tracked.\\nIn the square we have bridged a lot of gaps.  I\\'ve been living here since 29 January with tens of thousands of other people.  I put my head down to sleep and I don\\'t know the people sleeping around me. I have wonderful conversations with people from all over Egypt who normally I would never have talked to.\\nWe\\'re finally getting to know each other. It\\'s wonderful.',\n",

       " 'Kepler-452b orbits at a very similar distance from its star, though its radius is 60% larger.\\nMission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet.\\nSuch worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life.\\nNasa\\'s science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home.\\nIt is around 1,400 light years away from Earth.\\nJon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa\\'s Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It\\'s a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There\\'s a new kid on the block that\\'s just moved in next door.\"\\nThe new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth.\\nDetermining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own.\\nKepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth\\'s.\\nThe mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet.\\nThe new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars.\\nTwelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth\\'s diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star.\\nThis zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet\\'s surface if certain other conditions are also met.\\nOf these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet.\\nDr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I\\'ve come across for a confirmed planet to date.\\n\"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue.\\n\"It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.\"\\nWhile similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b\\'s host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth.\\n\"If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission.\\n\"The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\"\\n\"Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\"\\nDr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: \"Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet.\\n\"However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make.\\n\"So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\"\\nDr Chris Watson, from Queen\\'s University Belfast, UK, commented: \"Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii.\\n\"In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a \\'Super-Earth\\' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really \\'Earth-like\\' given all this?\"\\nHe added: \"When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating.\\n\"So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It\\'s this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.\"\\nThe findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal.\\nFollow Paul on Twitter.',\n",

       " 'Exeter Chiefs boss Rob Baxter also says a \"sacking culture\" comparable to football is creeping into rugby union.\\nLeicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill became the third boss sacked in eight months on Monday, while five left in five years before 2016.\\n\"It appears that coaches are a lot more vulnerable than they had been,\" said RCA founder and director Richard Moon.\\nMoon, a former Harlequins scrum-half and Rugby Football Union committee member who established the forerunner to the Rugby Players\\' Association, said one of the main reasons for setting up the RCA in 2012 was to prevent a \"football-like\" situation from developing.\\nBut, when asked whether rugby union was heading towards a hire-and-fire approach, Baxter told BBC Spotlight: \"The facts state that it is.\"\\nThe 45-year-old, who has been in charge of the club since 2009 when they were in the second tier, said job security for directors of rugby and coaches will \"unfortunately be driven by the professional game, the need to stay in the Premiership or be successful in the Premiership\".\\nCockerill was the second director of rugby sacked this season after Andy Robinson at Bristol, with Mike Ford leaving Bath as head coach last term - just 12 months after being named Premiership coach of the year and having only recently been linked with the England job.\\nMoon said the timing of recent departures was more damning than the increase in sackings themselves.\\n\"There have been more - but ever more interestingly it\\'s when they are happening,\" said Moon. \"They are tending, more recently, to happen during a season rather than at the end of a season.\\n\"As an association we are keeping an eye on these developments. More and more, if coaches are not given a reasonable and realistic chance to get to where they want to be in a season, short-termism is of real concern.\"\\nCockerill was sacked 12 games into the campaign with Leicester fifth in the table, just five points adrift of Bath in fourth spot, and having led Tigers to semi-finals in both the Premiership and European Champions Cup only last season.\\nIn his eight years in charge, Leicester never failed to reach the Premiership play-offs - winning three titles and finishing runners-up twice.\\nRobinson, the former England and Scotland head coach, was sacked by Bristol 10 games into the Premiership season, after guiding them back to the top flight following a seven-year absence last May.\\n\"There is more short-termism because rugby is big business now,\" added Moon.\\n\"There is more expectation on rugby coaches, certainly in the Premiership, to deliver - and if they are not delivering in a short time frame it would seem that owners are being more proactive than they have been in the past.\\n\"Coaches seem to be judged on short-term goals and results. Are they judged a bit like football managers in their first two or three games? Or do you get to Christmas, Easter or the Premiership play-offs? That time period is getting smaller and smaller.\"\\nSale director of rugby Steve Diamond admits his job is under scrutiny at the AJ Bell Stadium - with Sharks on an eight-match losing run - but he denies the turnover of coaches can be compared to football.\\n\"Are we under pressure? Definitely, we need to get some results,\" Diamond told BBC Radio Manchester.\\n\"But we know what we are doing and there is no-one better to get us out of the hole we are in than me.\"\\nWhen asked if he thought recent sackings were reactionary, Diamond said: \"No, not really. Each club is run differently and every club has different pressures.\"\\nTigers, English rugby\\'s most successful club with 10 domestic titles, last won silverware in 2013, beating Northampton Saints in the last of nine straight Premiership final appearances.\\nLeicester lock Ed Slater said the recent spate of sackings were \"what you guys want to write about\" when questioned by BBC Radio Leicester on the subject.\\n\"Cockers had been here for a long time,\" he said. \"We haven\\'t been to a Premiership final for three years now and at a club like Leicester we are aware of expectations and he ultimately paid the price - we know we want to win silverware and are expected to win silverware.\\n\"Four years without something is a long spell.\"\\nExeter boss Baxter said the growing popularity of Premiership rugby and increased riches in the game is where the pressure comes from.\\n\"The demands of crowds and rugby clubs and the money that is starting to come into the game through TV, a lot of these things are very positive - we work very hard to build our supporter base and a product that people want to buy.\\n\"Unfortunately, one of the repercussions of that is that people become more demanding. Sometimes, rightly or wrongly, in pursuit of success - or what is deemed to be success - someone pays the price.\\n\"The fact the Premiership is so competitive is something people should cherish and not be too afraid of. That is the balance you would like to think most clubs would come to.\\n\"You understand that a season will tilt with one or two injuries or one or two results. Having the strength to see that through is hopefully what we will get back to in rugby and we won\\'t see a cascade of sackings.\\n\"Some sackings and some changes of management happen for reasons outside of rugby results and those always happen - but when purely based on results people need a little more understanding.\"\\nMoon says he spoke to Richard Bevan, chief executive of football\\'s League Managers\\' Association (LMA), when forming the RCA and believes rugby coaches face some harsher realities than their football counterparts.\\n\"Unlike football, there is not enough professional or semi-professional clubs out there to realistically believe that if you lose your job you will walk into another one at the same level immediately. It is very rare,\" said Moon.\\n\"It is important that coaches get the right level of support and backing that their day job deserves.\\n\"Richard was incredibly helpful when we identified this idea. They are a juggernaut of an organisation that have been going for a long time and they do invaluable work.\\n\"We are some way behind that in the rugby world.\"\\nChris Jones, BBC Radio 5 live rugby union reporter\\n\"It is not necessarily a case that suddenly rugby union has adopted a different culture compared to before, but perhaps there are changes as a result of the competitiveness of the Premiership - influenced by the greater central revenues from Rugby Football Union and TV money - coupled with the new private investment at some clubs.\\n\"There are probably seven or eight clubs who truly feel they should occupy the top four - or be even better off - in the Premiership.\\n\"These clubs include Saracens, Wasps, Exeter, Bath, Leicester, Northampton, Harlequins, Gloucester, while Sale are a club that firmly considers themselves to be a top-six side. In saying that, Bristol, Worcester and Newcastle are all highly ambitious as well.\\n\"Wasps and Sale have been boosted by fairly recent private investment, while Gloucester are on the verge of a takeover. Bristol have a billionaire owner too. These are people who all want success, while the traditional powerhouses such as Leicester, Northampton and Harlequins also demand results.\\n\"No club is content with its status quo - maybe apart from European and Premiership champions Saracens - and with high expectations from fans and in the boardrooms, comes pressure on coaches - and sackings.\"',\n",

His reward was to land two excellent shots to Beltran's head in the closing stages of the sixth.\\nThe home fighter's recovery continued into the seventh as he made good use of a quick left jab, right-cross combination.\\nBut in the eighth round the champion was floored for the first time in three years with a sickening left hook to the head.\\nBurns took the count of eight to gather his senses and to his credit had the guts to hang in there and land a peach of a left hook on Beltran's chin. Worryingly for Burns's camp, the challenger did not flinch.\\nThe Scot's refusal to panic paid dividends in his bout against Gonzalez, when his opponent retired injured after nine rounds.\\nSimilarly, he kept calm in this bout despite that knockdown and the pain in his jaw and gave his all in rounds nine and 10, without truly disrupting the forward momentum of Beltran.\\nThe crowd feared that Burns might need a knockout in the final two rounds to retain his belt but the technical and tactical nous of Beltran made this seem a forlorn wish.\\nAgain and again, the fans witnessed the wonderfully composed Mexican break Burns's increasingly erratic defences without risking a knockout blow himself.\\nThe final round signalled more of the same, sporadic bursts by Burns merely interrupting the hail of leather-clad fists.\\nBut when the MC announced a draw, Beltran sharply exited the ring while the home fans, though proud of their brave champion, squirmed at the result.\\nOn the undercard, Edinburgh's Stephen Simmons lifted the WBC international cruiserweight silver championship title with a deserved unanimous points win over Germany's David Graf, though the Scot suffered a nasty cut under his left eye in the fifth round.\\nScott Cardle, from Lytham St Annes, with plenty of home support from the Glaswegian side of his family, beat Fishburn's Gary Fox, taking a 79-73 points decision in their lightweight contest.\\nLiverpool's 2010 Commonwealth Games silver medal winner Callum Smith dispatched Lithuanian super-middleweight Kirill Psonko in the first round.\\nGlasgow's Jonathan Slowey, 22, made it 15 straight wins by outpointing his rangy Spanish opponent Angel Lorente. The unanimous decision of the three judges landed him the WBC international featherweight silver championship.\\nGarnant's 25-year-old Prizefighter winner Chris Jenkins beat the French light-welterweight Laurent Ferra on points.\\nIt was also at that weight that Lochend Boxing Club's Paul Appleby made a winning return to the ring 15 months after his defeat by John Simpson. The South Queensferry fighter emerged from a bruising six-rounder against Chesterfield's Lee Connolly with a 59-56 triumph, a touch harsh on the Englishman.\",\n",

       " 'Labour leadership contender Andy Burnham says he is \"struggling\" with whether UK action would be legal or not. So what are the key legal questions?\\nParliament has already rejected military intervention in Syria, in 2013. Ministers say circumstances have changed since then (notably with the rise of IS) and that they would only proceed this time with the backing of Parliament. But this is not technically necessary. Although it has become convention since the 2003 Iraq war, there is no legal requirement for Parliamentary approval for military action.\\nMinisters say they would not proceed without a Commons vote - but they believe they have the authority, under international law, to intervene. Last month, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said there was \"no legal bar\" to the UK operating in Syria. In September, David Cameron suggested the UK could legally take military action in Syria without a request from President Assad, saying the Syrian president is \"illegitimate\".\\nThe UK is already carrying out air strikes on IS targets in Iraq. The UK says that as the Iraqi government requested intervention, this provides a \"clear and unequivocal legal basis\" for the military action. But no such request has been received from the Syrian government, and the UK sees the regime as illegitimate in any case. This means the legal arguments around intervention in Syria would be shaped by the complexities and conflicting interpretations of international law.\\nThe UN Charter bans \"the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state\" unless used in self-defence or authorised by a UN resolution. Those are the two \"classic justifications\" for military action, Prof Philippe Sands QC of University College London told the BBC.\\nA UN resolution is unlikely given Russian opposition, leaving the option of self-defence. This would require ministers to show military action was needed to prevent attacks on the UK or its citizens emanating from Syria. Alternatively, the self-defence argument could be used in relation to Iraq, which has already requested military assistance. This is the argument used by the United States, which is carrying out air strikes in Syria.\\nAs to whether this would work, \"we simply do not know enough about the facts\" to say definitely whether the self-defence argument is justified, says Prof Sands. He believes it would be \"a bit of a stretch\" on the basis of what is publicly available, adding that the UK appears to have \"no strategy and no clear basis of information to explain to the public what it is doing, and why it believes it is entitled in law to use force by way of self-defence\".\\nAnother option would be to justify the action on humanitarian grounds. This was the basis of the government\\'s case for intervention in 2013, when it focused on the possible use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Assad. Its legal position, published in August 2013, set out the three conditions that had to be met:\\n\"This puts the evidential bar both high and wide,\" BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman wrote at the time.\\nThe question would be whether the changed circumstances, with IS - also known as ISIS - militants controlling parts of Syria and fighting against government forces, would meet the test.\\nDr Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC there would be a \"quite plausible case\".\\n\"Given the behaviour we know of ISIS, the circumstances of the horrific civil war in Syria, it\\'s not difficult to construct a case that the humanitarian danger is grave and is immediate,\" he says.\\nAs well as the UN rules, \"customary international law\" has been established over the years.\\nOne option would be the right of \"hot pursuit\" of IS across borders, Dr Eyal says. Given that Iraq has requested international assistance in the fight against IS militants, the UK could argue that unless it can pursue them into Syria, they could \"seek refuge across the border and the situation will never end\", he says.\\nThis argument is strengthened by the inability of the Syria government to control its own territory he says, adding that hot pursuit is \"not an argument that lawyers are very comfortable with, but it has been made before\".\\nNo. Both the hot pursuit and humanitarian intervention arguments are \"controversial and contested\", Dr Eyal says, with governments accused of \"abusing the system\".\\nSome legal experts are not convinced any air strikes without specific Security Council authorisation would be consistent with international law, a Commons briefing paper points out.\\nSort of. A US-led coalition is already carrying out air strikes in Syria. Last month it emerged UK pilots had been embedded with coalition forces and conducting air strikes over Syria against IS. Amid criticism from Labour, Mr Fallon said embedding forces was \"standard practice\" and their engagement was not a \"British military operation\".\\nVery much so. The government\\'s insistence on securing Parliamentary approval means it will be MPs\\' interpretations of these intricacies of international law that will be key.\\nLast time MPs debated military intervention in Syria, opposition from backbench Conservatives and Ed Miliband-led Labour was enough to defeat the government.\\nHowever, MPs have since overwhelmingly backed action in Iraq, where the target was IS militants. Since those votes, the make-up of the Commons has changed, with the Conservatives holding a majority.\\nThe identity of Labour\\'s next leader - with surprise frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn certain to oppose any air strikes - is another complicating factor.',\n",

Most animals do.\"\\nThe first animal to reveal its UV sensitivity was the reindeer. And, as the researchers explained, reindeers\\' avoidance of the power lines running across the Arctic tundra was part of the inspiration for this project.\\nDr Nicholas Tyler, the other lead author, said it had been assumed that rather than avoiding the power cables themselves, animals steered clear of passages cut in forested areas before pylons were installed.\\n\"Forest animals will not cross clear-cuts,\" he said.\\n\"But for us in the Arctic, avoidance of power lines is difficult to explain - there are no trees, yet the reindeer still avoid the power lines.\"\\nThe animals keep as much as 5km (3 miles) from either side of the cables.\\n\"This has been a mystery,\" Dr Tyler added. \"We have now come up with a mechanism [to explain it].\"\\nThis research required a detailed understanding of animal vision, which was where Prof Jeffery came in.\\nHaving discovered in 2011 that reindeer eyes were sensitive to UV light, Prof Jeffery went on to study the eyes of almost 40 mammal species, revealing all were UV-sensitive.\\nSince, as the researchers added, coronas \"happen on all power lines everywhere\", the avoidance of the flashes could be having a global impact on wildlife.\\n\"It has always been assumed that power lines - masts and the cables strung between them - were passive structures standing immobile in the terrain, and therefore inoffensive for animals,\" said Dr Tyler.\\n\"As a result of this work, we now consider them as chains of flashing light stretching across the tundra in the winter darkness, and that\\'s why the animals find them so offensive.\"\\nThe random and unpredictable nature of these flashes were particularly problematic, he added, as the animals could not easily adapt to them.\\nProf Jeffery said he hoped power companies would now consider ways to address the issue.',\n",

You get to meet thousands of interesting visitors and everybody\\'s here to have a good day out.\"\\nMr Smith said since 1902 the railway, which has always included a passenger service, had only stopped operating once - during World War Two.\\n\"Pretty much everything in the country shut down,\" he said.\\n\"As part of the war effort it stopped operation, but I\\'m told the day the war ended they steamed the engine up and blew the whistle all the way down the line.\\n\"Someone said that was their first memory of the railway.\"\\nSimon Cowan, carriage and locomotive painter, is trained as a fireman and a driver.\\n\"The main thing is to make things from scratch, to replace items which are no longer made,\" he said.\\n\"So we copy them faithfully and make them all in the old fashioned way and then I pass these skills on to other people, it\\'s a bit like a big museum.\\n\"It\\'s the older people, I\\'m one of them, who have grown up in that specialist knowledge, that area, passing those skills on - because I will get to the point where I can\\'t do this any more.\\n\"I show people how to paint, it\\'s a lovely way of seeing people develop, so when I go on holiday I\\'m not thinking \\'gosh what are they doing to my paint shop\\'.\\n\"We also put them out on the trains as firemen and guards, and we teach them as much as we can.\\n\"Carriages are painted with 24 carat gold leaf and they go \\'wow that must be so expensive\\', well no it\\'s so wafer thin.\\n\"We show them how to make a tracing of a word and get the typeface correct and show them how to apply the lettering on to a piece of wood, and then we\\'ll use this varnish and paint that on to there, and when the varnish is sticky put the gold leaf on and peel it off and \\'wow, that\\'s great\\'.\\n\"Then I\\'ll say \\'give us your thumb\\' and put a bit of varnish on, just let that dry, and gold leaf their thumb and they think it\\'s hilarious - but then they\\'ve learnt how to do it. It\\'s really fun.\"\\nMr Cowan added because the carriages dated back to the 1920s and 30s, work had been going into improving disability access - with a new platform planned.\\nAnd a great deal of work has to go into maintaining the locomotives and the 12 miles of track.\\nMr Smith said: \"With steam railways, the equipment we use is very bespoke.\\n\"You can\\'t get the parts off the shelf, so you make them yourself... it\\'s very specialist and it\\'s good to keep the skills in the local area.\\n\"The last few years we\\'ve built a really renowned workshop and that allows us not only to do our own work but also take on work for other businesses, other railways.\"\\nHe added: \"In the far end of the workshop there\\'s a cattle van which is coming together which was supplied new to us in the 1920s.\\n\"There were stories of livestock going up to Devil\\'s Bridge in wagons, so they decided to build two cattle vans but unfortunately it was a bit too late for the demand - most livestock was going by road by then.\\n\"So they became redundant and the vehicle went to another railway and more recently it\\'s come back to us and our job is to restore it back to how it would have been.\"',\n",

However, the Irishman\\'s failure, along with fellow striking additions Paul Heffernan and the now-departed Rowan Vine, to come anywhere near matching the goal rate of former loanee Leigh Griffiths perhaps more than anything led to Pat Fenlon\\'s departure as manager.\\nNew boss Terry Butcher says it will be the summer before he is able to reshape the squad in the way he wants, so for now he is having to hope that Danny Haynes, on loan from Notts County, or Sunderland teenager Duncan Watmore will provide the extra goalscoring spark. Meanwhile, on-loan Arsenal defender Daniel Boateng will be aiming for more game time than he achieved at Swindon Town and Oxford United.\\nIn: Loan: Daniel Boateng, defender (Arsenal); Danny Haynes, forward (Notts County); Duncan Watmore, forward (Sunderland)\\nOut: Rowan Vine, forward (Morton); Fraser Mullen, defender (Raith Rovers); Tim Clancy, defender.

Which, in addition to a budget made tighter by an early Scottish Cup exit, perhaps explains why he was also the least active in January.\\nHis priority was the extension of winger Lionel Ainsworth\\'s loan from Rotherham United and retaining striker Henri Anier, who has now made a permanent switch from Viking Stavanger. Neither Anier, nor fellow summer arrival John Sutton, has managed to match individually the scoring rate of Michael Higdon, who left for Nijmegen. However, as a partnership, with 18 goals between them, they are well on their way to surpassing the total of 31 reached last season by the Englishman and Anier\\'s departed Estonia team-mate, Henrik Ojamaa.\\nIn: Loan to permanent: Henri Anier, forward (Viking Stavanger)\\nOut: Loan ended: Dan Twardzik, goalkeeper (Dundee).

So in has come Lyle Taylor, who manager Alan Archibald witnessed terrorising Scottish Championship defences while with Falkirk before heading for Sheffield United. Three goals in his first two games showed promise, but none in his next four suggests the Englishman will need more creative help from a midfield bolstered by three loan signings - Prince Buaben, Chris Erskine and George Moncur - who arrived just before the January deadline.\\nIn: Lee Mair, defender (St Mirren).

Graeme Shinnie and Kenny McLean were commanding.\\nThey lived in their faces defensively and showed plenty offensively. The feeling was that Aberdeen had to take the lead to make a true fight of this final and that is precisely what they did.\\nHaving shipped three early goals to Celtic in their last meeting, the Dons changed the narrative.\\nFrom a Niall McGinn corner, Hayes came round the blindside of Leigh Griffiths and smashed a volley past goalkeeper Craig Gordon and beyond Kieran Tierney on the line.\\nIt was a goal of quality and a goal that electrified the huge Aberdeen support.\\nCeltic are champions, though, and their true selves emerged only two minutes later when Aberdeen unwisely stood off Armstrong, who thumped in the equaliser low to Lewis's left.\\nTwo early goals and the intensity only cranked up from there.

       " 'But what really strikes you, especially in those initial developmental stages, is how familiar the forms look. How like an early human foetus, they appear.\\n\"This is something you see time and time again in vertebrates, not just with mammals,\" says Richard Sabin, the Natural History Museum\\'s top whale expert.\\n\"You see these similarities in the early developmental stages and it\\'s really not until you\\'re halfway through the gestation - which  for a humpback whale is around 11 months - that you start to see the things that make that foetus characteristically the species that it is.\"\\nRichard has a remarkable sequence of seven humpback foetuses that he\\'s going to put on display for the NHM\\'s major summer exhibition on cetaceans.\\nThey go from what is essentially just a ball of cells that\\'s perhaps only a few weeks old, all the way through to a specimen that appears to be a perfect humpback in miniature.\\nThis larger foetus, about half a metre in length, is probably seven to eight months into the gestation period. It has everything you would expect to see in a humpback, including those long, tell-tale pectoral flippers with their nobbly tubercles.\\nThe specimens were collected at the beginning of the 20th Century by scientists who had been sent to the Antarctic to gather data on the activities of the whaling fleets.\\nTheir role was to understand the biology, the movements, and the ecology of whales - to appreciate the status of stocks so that the commercial returns could be maximised. It\\'s an awkward feeling knowing that these foetuses were taken from harpooned pregnant humpbacks.\\nSomehow you have to console yourself with the recognition that the acquired data was ultimately what shut down that bloody industry.\\n\"There is a story with every specimen and it may not be a very comfortable story, but it is something we have to acknowledge,\" says Richard.\\n\"The thing to remember is that the data we get from these specimens we actively use for marine conservation purposes now.\"\\nJust this past week, a Swiss-led team used old whaling data to show how species had shrunk in size in the 40 years prior to the stocks collapsing. This trend signal, the team said, could be used to warn of imminent disaster in other hunted wildlife groups.\\nWhat have we learned from foetuses, specifically? A lot it seems about evolutionary biology.\\n\"One thing we see in these humpbacks is the development of tooth buds at around four-to-five months into gestation. They\\'re then reabsorbed to allow the baleen to start to develop,\" explains Richard. The baleen are the keratin plates that hang from the upper-jaw and filter the humpbacks\\' prey.\\n\"So, we know from the study of these foetuses, from an evolutionary developmental perspective, that there was a time when all cetaceans were toothed and that baleen are a relatively recent development. And we\\'ve only just found the fossils that back that up.\"\\nThe whales exhibition is due to open on 14 July, the day after the NHM re-opens its front entrance. The Hintze Hall has been remodelled. Its emblematic diplodocus (\"Dippy\") dinosaur is being replaced by a blue whale skeleton that will hang from the ceiling (Plot spoiler: I\\'ve had a sneak peek already and it looks spectacular).\\nSo, it\\'s certainly a timely moment to highlight the contribution of cetaceans to life on Earth.\\nMore than 100 specimens from the London museum\\'s collections are being set up in the institution\\'s Waterhouse Gallery.\\nThe exhibition will impress upon visitors the huge diversity of whales, dolphins and porpoises. It will explain their relatively short evolutionary journey, from being land animals 50 million years ago to becoming the well-adapted ocean-dwellers we know today.\\nAnd it will describe how they move, how they breathe, and how some echolocate to find their prey. It still astounds me that whales can communicate over many hundreds of kilometres.\\n\"We want people to realise that as well as being mammals like us, they also have complex culture like us,\" says Richard. \"This is a very new area of study that has accelerated in just the past 10 years through observations, through genetic information and the data coming from museum specimens.\"\\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos',\n",

believers still bathe there today and Holywell has become known as the \"Lourdes of Wales\".\\nIn 1138, Prior Robert of Shrewsbury moved the saint\\'s remains to his abbey, later writing a \"Life\" - or biography - of Winefride, which was to prove instrumental in spreading her popularity.\\nIn medieval times, she became the saintly equivalent of a superstar.\\n\"Winefride, or Gwenfrewy as she is known in Welsh, is the only native female saint from Wales to have a substantial hagiographical dossier,\" says Prof Jane Cartwright, from the University of Wales Trinity St David.\\n\"She was effectively a Welsh super saint whose cult extended beyond the Welsh border, since her relics were translated to Shrewsbury.\\n\"She had two 12th Century Latin Lives and a 15th Century Welsh Life and she is one of the very few Welsh saints to make it into the Roman Martyrology.\\nProf Cartwright, who is editing the medieval Welsh life of St Winefride for the Cult of Saints in Wales project, which aims to publish a digital edition of some 100 medieval Welsh-language texts on saints, adds: \"In a sense her cult united England and Wales and she was deemed suitable to be venerated by royalty,\"\\nAt least six royal visitors - including Richard I, Edward IV and James II - have come to Holywell over the centuries.\\nBy far the most famous visit was by Henry V in 1416, who, having placed himself under the spiritual protection of St Winefride before the previous year\\'s Battle of Agincourt - where his 6,000 men faced a French army six times the size - walked from Shrewsbury to the shrine to thank her for his victory.\\nThe precise date and route of the pilgrimage is unknown; in fact the only written record of it is in Latin, in the Chronicle of Adam of Usk so re-enacting the walk to commemorate its 600th anniversary has presented a challenge.\\n\"There have been many attempts to work out the route,\" says walk organiser Ron Williams, from the Holywell Walkers are Welcome group.\\n\"But when you think about it, there is only one way Henry V would have come.\\n\"There weren\\'t any roads except those the Romans had left and the Roman road comes to Llangollen from Shrewsbury, so that is most likely how he would have started off.\\n\"On top of that he would have known that there was a Cistercian Abbey at Valle Crucis, so it\\'s logical that he came there and if you look at a map, there\\'s a direct line between Llangollen and Holywell so all we\\'ve done is put a walking route as near to that as possible.\\n\"Of course we can\\'t know it for sure but we think our route is more logical than those which have been put forward before.\\n\"We have a good number of people walking the whole thing but we also want people to join in for the day so we\\'ve tried to make the walks easy to start and finish,\" adds Mr Williams.\\nThe walkers - including one dressed as Henry V - will be welcomed into Holywell on 24 June.\\nThe following day, the \"King\" will immerse himself in St Winefride\\'s well.\\nAn interdenominational service, an afternoon of talks on St Winefride and a medieval festival - complete with storytellers, jesters, archery and combat displays - are also part of the anniversary celebrations.\\nIt is hoped the events will provide what festival organiser Mrs Owen claims is a \"much-needed\" boost for the Flintshire town.\\n\"Holywell has been neglected,\" she said.\\n\"It\\'s like an unpolished diamond, a bit rough around the edges and it needs lots of little improvements.\\n\"We want to get a much higher profile for the town with this - we want to really put it on the map.\"\\nKerry Feather, project director of  St Winefride\\'s Well, agreed: \"We want the town and the well to benefit from the attention.\\n\"We currently have around 35,000 visitors every year and we really would like to boost that number.\\n\"Some people come here for healing but others just find it a place of peace and sanctuary, somewhere to spend time, whether it\\'s in prayer or thought, in an oasis of calm in the middle of a very busy world.\"\\nThe organisers of this year\\'s pilgrimage re-enactment also want it to have a lasting legacy - they have applied for Lottery funding for the creation of a new pilgrim\\'s trail from Shrewsbury to Holywell, complete with waymarkers.\\n\"Walking a pilgrim\\'s trail is not just a walk, it\\'s a different experience altogether,\" said Mr Williams.\\n\"I\\'m not religious but you\\'re walking in places where people have walked for centuries and it gets to you.\\n\"You think, \\'Why were they here, how did they get here, how did they feel?\\'\\n\"It\\'s quite an emotional experience and you get a real sense of connection to the history of the places along the route.\"',\n",

Part of a previous era, it was a magnificent five miles of twists and turns, uphill and down, which started with two incredible, banked, high-speed left-handers, taken absolutely flat out by some, still visible outside the modern Turns One, Two and Three.\\nIt all adds to the character of the place.

       " \"For all that it may sound attractive to the Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish to have greater influence over their respective economic destinies, presumably that would be less desirable if at a stroke they became poorer.\\nThe point is that as and when there is an English parliament for English people - of the sort that the former Tory minister John Redwood has been demanding, and David Cameron seemed to concede today - the financial transfer from England to the rest of the UK may be harder to sustain.\\nSo these constitutional reforms will be tricky, if not dangerous - if at least a part of the current glue that holds the UK together is a redistribution of resources from England to the rest, and that glue is progressively removed.\\nBeing British right now means in part that public services and living standards are not too far apart in quantum and quality wherever you happen to live. But what if the overhaul of the UK's budget-making or fiscal constitution waters down that glue.\\nHow much is at stake?\\nWell, spending on public-sector services per head is highest in Northern Ireland, £10,900 and it is lowest in England, at £8,500.\\nThe figure for Scotland - beneficiary of the famous or notorious Barnett Formula, which formalises an income transfer from England to Scotland - is £10,200.\\nSo expenditure on public services in Scotland is a fifth higher per person than south of the border, and it is 28% higher in Northern Ireland.\\nIn Wales, the increment on public-service spending is 14% - which the Welsh have often complained is too little, compared with the transfer of income to Scotland.\\nNow one way of looking at the scale of the transfer is to look at the amount of income - or what is known as gross value added - generated in each country.\\nSo English gross value added per head is highest, at just under £22,000, and it is lowest in Wales at £15,400.\\nThe English enjoy public-service spending per annum equivalent to under 40% of the income they generate, whereas annual outlays on public services in Wales are equivalent to more than 60% of nationally generated income per head.\\nThe ratios for Scotland and Northern Ireland are just over 50% and not far off 70% respectively.\\nIn a UK of considerable social and cultural solidarity that prevailed for most of the twentieth century, these sorts of disparities between income and outlay between the nations were relatively uncontroversial: they captured the idea that all UK citizens are in it together, as it were.\\nBut today it seems almost inevitable that in David Cameron's brave new world of greater national fiscal self-determination, some English nationalist MPs on the right of the spectrum may increasingly view Wales - and Scotland and Northern Ireland - as de facto socialist paradises excessively featherbedded by the English.\\nThat said, if the nations are given much greater control over income taxes - which appears to be what is on offer - could they not pay for whatever public services they feel they need out of these locally levied taxes?\\nNot remotely.\\nIncome and other direct taxes per head in Wales raise £5,564, considerably less than the UK average of £7,360, and nowhere near enough to cover public service expenditure.\\nThere is a similar mismatch between direct income taxes and public spending throughout the UK.\\nBorrowing and indirect taxes, mostly VAT, make up the difference. And there is not the faintest chance that national parliaments will be given the power to increase VAT, because this would be an admin nightmare for businesses and undermine the UK as a frictionless single market.\\nAll of which means that it may sound exciting and empowering in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland to make their own choices about taxing and spending.\\nBut it may also be a bit nerve-wracking (or worse) if it provides cover for Westminster to reduce the income transferred to them from English taxpayers.\",\n",

Yet we were just two guys filling bottles by hand.\"\\nWith Tesco wanting first deliveries in four months\\' time, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie, also now 32, went to their bank to ask for another £150,000, so they could quickly install a bottling line, and expand production.\\nBut failing to meet the payments on their existing loan, the bank said a firm \"no\".\\nSo the business partners went to another lender, and lied.\\nMr Watt says: \"We said that our bank had offered us an amazing deal, but that if you can match it we\\'ll switch, and they went for it. You have got to do what you have to do.\"\\nWith BrewDog now being able to increase its brewing facilities, it was able to start supplying Tesco on time with bottles of its Punk IPA.\\nThe beer was an immediate hit, and the other UK supermarkets soon followed suit.\\nFast forward to 2014, and BrewDog is due to see its turnover top £32m this year.\\nIt employs 357 people, and as well as continuing to supply the likes of Tesco UK-wide, it owns 25 bars, 18 across the UK, and seven abroad.\\nAnd now based at a larger brewery down the road in the town of Ellon, it exports to 52 countries.\\nChildhood friends who grew up in the Scottish town of Peterhead, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie started brewing beer together as a hobby in their early 20s.\\nAt the time Mr Watt was working as a deep sea fisherman, while Mr Dickie was a whisky distiller.\\nFrom the very start they were inspired to brew American-style craft beers - sweet-tasting ales with high alcohol levels and very large amounts of US hops, which gave them a bold, fruity, even perfumed flavour.\\nThey are very Marmite beers in that you either love them or hate them. To fans they are flavoursome and interesting, to critics they are undrinkable.\\nYet, confident they could convert drinkers, and after some good reviews, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie decided to quit their day jobs and start brewing professionally in 2007.\\n\"Even though the first year was tough, we never lost faith in what we were doing,\" says Mr Watt. \"We were hell-bent... we were stupidly ambitious.\"\\nIn addition to the bold flavours, the two men also worked hard on creating an irreverent brand image for BrewDog, giving their beers fun names, and bright, colourful labels. Some of their other brews are called Dead Pony Pale Ale, Dogma and Hardcore IPA.\\nExpansion has been made possible after the business raised £7m via crowdfunding, with 15,000 people paying £95 for a stake in the company. In return they get discounts in BrewDog\\'s bars, and other perks.\\nIn more controversial matters, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie have also regularly - and enthusiastically - attacked regulators and industry bodies. Their critics say they do so simply to garner publicity, but Mr Watt says they are merely sticking up for themselves.\\nEarlier this year the Portman Group, the UK drinks industry trade body that promotes responsible drinking, criticised BrewDog, saying that the label of the brewery\\'s Dead Pony Pale Ale promoted anti-social behaviour and binge drinking.\\nBrewDog\\'s response at the time was as follows: \"Unfortunately, the Portman Group is a gloomy gaggle of killjoy jobsworths, funded by navel-gazing international drinks giants.\"\\nWhen contacted by the BBC for this article, a spokesman for the Portman Group said: \"BrewDog\\'s business model has traditionally used complaints by the public as a PR opportunity for their brands.\\n\"BrewDog and the Portman Group have a long history... we don\\'t expect them to like us, but we were pleased to see they have started relabeling their products.\"\\nThere are no hard and fast rules on what makes a \"craft beer\". However, typically it is a natural beer made by a small brewery, often with large amounts of pungent hops and a marked sweetness from the barley malt\\nSo what is the difference between \"craft beer\" and \"real ale\"? Unlike craft beer, real ale - as determined by UK pressure group Campaign For Real Ale - has to be unpasteurised and unfiltered. Real ale also more often has a drier flavour.\\nCraft beer is also typically served well chilled and carbonated, whereas real ales are served less cold and have no added gas\\nYet, like lager (which itself can be a craft beer or real ale), they share the same basic four ingredients - malted barley, hops, yeast and water. In all cases other ingredients can be added on top, such as different grains\\nA similar dispute that BrewDog had in 2013 with the UK\\'s advertising watchdog, the ASA, saw Mr Watt call the officials \"killjoy, self-important pen pushers\".\\nBrewDog has also been criticised for selling some beers with exceptionally high alcohol rates, such as a limited edition ale that was 55% alcohol.\\nMr Watt says that he and Mr Dickie - who together own a 75% share of the business - remain unrepentant, and simply \"make beers that we want to drink ourselves\".\\nMr Watt adds that BrewDog\\'s products are bought by beer aficionados, and priced at a premium. He says that if someone is going to abuse alcohol they will be the cheaper, mass market beers that give drinkers \"maximum bang for their buck\".\\nWith exports now making up 65% of sales, Mr Watt says they have no plans to slow down the fast-paced growth.\\n\"My worry is that we aren\\'t growing fast enough,\" he says.',\n",

Whether you like it or not, this is a sporting event that cannot be ignored.\\nLas Vegas is a city that constantly beguiles visitors into altering their perceptions - and, at times, their common sense - in a haze of hedonistic pleasures. Mayweather v McGregor, with its unabashed glorification of money, image and bravado, fits perfectly within the daily excesses of the world\\'s gambling capital.\\nSaturday\\'s fight will pit a man widely considered one of the greatest exponents of his sport against a mixed martial artist who has never boxed professionally.\\nThe outcome should be simple to determine, no matter McGregor\\'s mantra and hubristic claim he is ready to \"shock the world\".\\nBut remember this is Vegas. And many believe McGregor\\'s sleight of hand against an ageing Mayweather could provide a major upset. It will be no illusion if he does win, ranking as one of the greatest shocks in sporting history.\\nThe debate as to who will triumph will sway back and forth in the coming days - pumped up, no doubt, by yet more hateful invective from the two chief protagonists.\\nThe true verdict can only be delivered in the ring, in what is likely to be the richest fight in boxing history.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nTickets for the venue have not yet sold out - but with an expected five million pay-per-view purchases, the cash will cascade in from those sitting watching at home and at venues around the world.\\nThe smell of money permeates the Las Vegas strip at the best of times. This week, the stench is inescapable.\\nBoth fighters and their camps have been candid in admitting the contest is all about the cash. However, the language they have used to boost their mega pay day has been disgraceful.\\nA five-city publicity tour in July became a nauseating race to the bottom as each man tried to find fresh insults to hurl at one another.\\nHomophobic put-downs, and racially motivated slurs and stereotypes have soured the build-up to this contest. It was difficult not to wince when McGregor turned to his opponent on the final leg of the tour at Wembley and told him to \"dance for me, boy\".\\nHowever, both men are equally culpable given their behaviour.\\nDana White, the UFC president who is representing McGregor, believes it is all justified.\\n\"It\\'s funny when people say they\\'ve taken this thing too far,\" he said.\\n\"This is a fight, not a croquet game. This part of the deal; the reality is what\\'s going on here is just as much part of the fight as the fight itself, the mental warfare game.\"\\nIt is at this point the true reality of this contest has not been altered but frankly obliterated.\\nContext is everything and this fight is not taking place in a vacuum.

This contest provides an opportunity for examples to be set but it has, so far, been wasted.\\nTrash talk and one-upmanship is one thing. It has always been a part of prize fighting.\\nLanguage that divides and excludes - that seemingly legitimises homophobic, sexist and racist behaviour - is something else entirely.\\nThey certainly aren\\'t the first boxers to trade in such terms.\\nThough both men later apologised, Manny Pacquaio shamefully called people in same-sex marriages \"worse than animals\", while Tyson Fury expressed a Neanderthal view that a woman\\'s best place is \"on her back or in the kitchen\".\\nThe truth is boxing offers girls and boys a chance to build self-esteem, to train and dedicate themselves to a higher goal. It provides hope, and often an escape, for many.\\nYou just have to listen to Mike Costello and Steve Bunce\\'s recent podcast from the burnt-out Grenfell Tower to see what boxing can do for a community. The building housed a gym with volunteer coaches, all unpaid, giving their time and knowledge to help transform lives. The hope is it can rise again.\\nBut some of the most powerful men at the top of the sport have failed time and again to see the gift they possess to inspire and encourage everyone, of all backgrounds, to get involved.\\nMayweather and McGregor, cosseted in their elite world of Lamborghinis, Louis Vuitton luggage and flashy Las Vegas nightspots, appear to have forgotten this too.\\nTheir humble beginnings at gyms in Michigan and Dublin respectively should serve as a reminder of the chances they were provided with.\\nTheir respective combat sports have given them untold riches. This week their bank accounts will swell further.\\nWith no boxing federation overseeing the bout and the Nevada State Athletic Commission - which sanctioned the fight - refusing to get involved, both Mayweather and McGregor can act however they wish.\\nEven the UFC, in which McGregor made his name, has allowed the Irishman\\'s actions to go unchecked of late. His volatile behaviour before recent events has seen him throw bottles and even try to hurl a chair at an opponent.\\nThere is arguably a responsibility for the two most recognisable figures in combat sports to be more guarded with their words and to realise they are custodians; to extol the virtues of the sport that has given them everything.\\nTheir most dangerous weapons, it seems, are not their fists but their tongues.\\nNo-one expects them to be angels - the true, unaltered reality this week is they have a fight to sell and money to make. And on Saturday a truly intriguing sporting contest will take place.\\nHowever, the orgy of excess that surrounds it threatens to further sully a sport that right now needs all the help it can get to maintain popularity and relevance.\\nWhat happens in Vegas should, according to the old saying, stay in Vegas.

       " \"Media playback is not supported on this device\\nThen you look at the statistics, and a more complicated picture emerges: a 30-point winning margin but less possession than Italy, less territory, more tackles missed and fewer line breaks made.\\nNit-picking or nagging doubts? That is the problem with thrilling wins like the one in Cardiff: they inflate expectations, convince the giddy that a team is not just ascendant but untroubled.\\nEngland started slowly, again, and were once again behind with a quarter of the contest gone. They then took control for half an hour, played with pace and imagination and considerable verve, and were out of sight by the time Italy staged their late and immaterial fight-back.\\nThat will be enough for some. In the corresponding fixture two years ago Stuart Lancaster's men were held try-less. In Jonathan Joseph they had not only Saturday's outstanding performer but a young dancer and dasher who is terrifying defenders and delighting supporters every time he is given the ball.\\nLancaster, for one, wants more. Miss 22 tackles in Dublin on Sunday week and he knows dreams of a Grand Slam will remain exactly that. Give away breakdown penalties to a side with a player who can kick off the tee - Ireland's Johnny Sexton will not be as profligate as Italy 10 Kelly Haimona - and it will be a far steeper road back.\\nFor George Ford, man of the match in the Millennium, this was a different sort of challenge in a different sort of match.\\nSo far in his nascent Test career the 21-year-old fly-half has had to deal with a disorganised Samoa, an Australian pack going backwards at pace and a giant Welsh back-line determined to dent both his confidence and body.\\nA week ago there was plenty of kicking from hand, a resolve under intense pressure, a premium on his penalty points.\\nOn Saturday he could have missed every effort from the Twickenham turf and still seen his side win with something to spare. Instead it was all about the attack - controlling the tempo, choosing his options, freeing the talent outside him.\\nHe began well, clearing from his own line off his weaker foot after Ben Youngs' poor pass had cut his time and space. A minute later he was putting a probing kick deep into Italian territory, dabbing another into the 22 only to see it gathered to begin the move that led, 70 metres and two minutes later, to Sergio Parisse's opening try for Italy.\\nFord, as the win over Wales showed, is not cowed by early disappointment. It was his precision long-range penalty tight to the corner flag that set up England's opening try through Billy Vunipola's line-out drive, his ability to play flat to the gain-line that was creating options for the runners and ball-carriers cantering in support.\\nNot always did he make the right choice. Half an hour in he wasted turnover ball with a poor kick straight down the gullet of his opposite number Haimona. At other times he became a fraction static, passing the ball standing still rather than running at the defensive line to commit and confuse defenders.\\nBut in his vision and hands he has what England fans crave from their number 10: creativity, a little conjuring, the quickness of mind and foot to make it count against a well-drilled defence.\\nSo it was in the move that led to Joseph's second try. He hung behind his pack, hinting that he might drift down the blind-side, then scything back round to the open spaces on the right after Billy Twelvetrees had come in at first receiver.\\nTwelvetrees timed his pass behind Luther Burrell, and then Ford worked his magic - spotting Anthony Watson drawing one defender wide, faking a quick pass outside to Joseph and then delaying it a fraction as the covering man committed, before popping up a pass for his Bath team-mate to come onto at full pace.\\nAfter the conversion he was gone, replaced for the final hurrah by another creative mind in Danny Cipriani. But the learning-curve continues, his precocious talents an increasingly pivotal part of Lancaster's plans.\\nHis personal stats were solid rather than spectacular: 15 points, just one kick missed from tee from seven, 47 metres made with ball in hand, 31 accurate passes. His kicking style requires a little further fine-tuning, even if he has improved markedly in the last year.\\nThere is so much there, and at such a young age, that few doubt that the progression will continue.\\nThere is the character, preternatural yet visible from the moment he began playing in England's age-group teams ahead of his time. There are the little details, like the way he manages to almost imperceptibly shift his weight in contact to ride out or roll big tackles. And there is ambition: this is not enough, I must do more.\\nThere is also a connection with the key men outside him.

One is potential revenue from carmakers in the long term.\\nAnd what is also crucial to the development of self-driving vehicles is data. The more cars using its technology, the more data it should be able to harvest.\\n\"It really sounds like they want to treat this like a smartphone platform,\" Mr Chao said. \"The holy grail for software in cars is to become the Android or iOS that everyone is using, and this is their strategy to do that.\"\\nBaidu\\'s statement alludes to opportunities in the US, but also in its home market.\\n\"China is the world\\'s largest market for automotive sales and production. It has many car brands and an open environment that is ripe for collaboration,\" group president Qi Lu said.\\nAnalyst Mr Chao agrees. \"I can think of at least 20 Chinese carmakers who would be perfect candidates,\" he told the BBC.\\n\"They don\\'t have huge research budgets or the resources to figure out how to make self-driving vehicles themselves.\\n\"These are firms that tend to rely on suppliers so they can build a car and so this fits in perfectly for them.\"\\nHe said this could mean that Baidu\\'s technology will be used in millions of cars on China\\'s roads by 2020.\\nHowever, bigger international carmakers who are already working on autonomous vehicles are unlikely to follow suit.\\nMotivated by the widespread pollution problems, Beijing has pushed for more electric vehicles and Chinese carmakers have responded significantly.\\nAnd in the race for driverless car technology, Chinese companies are taking big strides. Along with Changan and Geely, Baidu is one of the big players, with AI research being done in both China and Silicon Valley.\\nBut it is not clear how the software and hardware Baidu has developed compares with that of its rivals.

The attention to detail is stunningly intricate and it was Manchester City\\'s own training complex which offered key elements of the blueprint.\\nA group of journalists are led through the $14m development by Forrest Griffin, a retired UFC light-heavyweight champion and now a vice-president with focus on athlete development.\\nHe paints details around what we see at the 30,000 square feet facility, which opened in May. Some 23 years have passed since UFC was formed but this building is seen as a game changer which will take the welfare and performance of athletes to new levels.\\nIt is far removed from the spit and sawdust gyms which shaped some of boxing\\'s greatest names. Some 24 hours earlier, I visited the Mayweather Boxing Gym, a world-renowned facility which inside is straightforward, humble and brilliantly effective.\\nBut the UFC institute cuts with tradition in pursuit of gains. Measurability, science and mapped progress shape the mantra.\\nGriffin explains how recovery is meticulously plotted. He points to one of his own injuries and a subsequent substantial difference in mass between his two quad muscles, detected after his retirement. A UFC fighter at the Institute would be scanned during rehabilitation to highlight which muscles have suffered during their lay-off so targeted rebuilding can be done.\\nAny fighter competing under the UFC banner can train here at no cost.\\nTailored workout programmes appear on screens next to weight stations. If an athlete is only here for a short spell, their data and subsequent training plan will be sent to an app to use at their traditional base.\\nWhatever the goal - recovery, strength, mobility, technique - there is a desire to offer a menu of ways to work on it. As Griffin stresses, what works for one individual will do nothing for another.\\nIn the recovery area, for example, athletes can opt for use of a cryotherapy chamber or laser-light therapy. Both will stimulate circulation, flushing away lactic acid and easing aches and pains.\\nFacilities are purposely placed one room apart to ease access. We pass through a door and Griffin fires up the underwater treadmill McGregor has been filmed using in recent weeks.\\n\"Conor has had a knee injury in the past so he doesn\\'t like to do roadwork,\" says Griffin, 38.  \"So he does a lot of bike work and he uses this as it has no impact on your body and you can work hard.\"\\nTwo pools next to the underwater treadmill offer temperatures of 105F and 50F respectively to again offer variety in recovery.\\nGriffin explains why McGregor\\'s typical routine of sleeping in until midday makes perfect sense.\\n\"He\\'s been here once or twice a day for six weeks,\" adds Griffin. \"Training at the time you fight is under appreciated.

Consequently, UFC athletes can only exit the building by passing a nutritional team.\\n\"We learned from mistakes people had made in the past,\" adds Griffin. \"A facility and its staff may be too spread out. Manchester City have a great layout. The locker room is the centre of the building. The athletes start and end in the locker room so you build every service around that.\\n\"Every sport taxes the human body a certain way.

       " 'But there is a mismatch between those soothing words and the aggressive trade policies laid out during the campaign - which included harsh tariffs on China and tearing up existing agreements.\\nIt is hard to know if Mr Trump will follow up on his threats, but they have a combustive potential.\\nAnd trade is one area where the president has freedom to act without the approval of lawmakers in Congress.\\nFive questions on economy for Trump\\nUK businesses react to Trump\\'s win\\nTrump\\'s economic promises\\nPresident Trump: All hat, now where are the cattle?\\nSo what did we learn during the campaign about Mr Trump\\'s views on trade? Well, you can find a summary of his policies on his campaign website, but here\\'s a quick tour.\\nPerhaps his most radical idea is to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese-made goods, if China does not reform its trade relations with the US.\\nMr Trump has floated the idea of a swingeing 45% tariff on Chinese imports.\\nIn a big economic policy speech in June he told workers at a metal processing plant that China had \"cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficit and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property\".\\nDuring that speech he reminded workers that President Reagan had imposed tariffs of 45% on Japanese motorcycles and 100% on computer chips.\\nIf Mr Trump\\'s threat crystallised it would supply a shock to the US economy as China is an important supplier of many goods.\\nTake mobile devices for example. China supplies three-quarters of the phones imported into the US and it supplies almost all laptop and tablet computers.\\nMr Trump has also been scathing about the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).\\nIntroduced in 1994 it greatly reduced, and in some cases eliminated altogether, tariffs for trade between the US and its two immediate neighbours, Mexico and Canada.\\n\"Nafta was the worst trade deal in the history of this country,\" Mr Trump said in June.\\nHe blames the deal for the loss of thousands of US manufacturing jobs and wants to reverse that by renegotiating the terms of the deal.\\nIf Mexico and Canada do not agree to the new terms, Mr Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement altogether.\\nIn February, after five years of work, the US and 11 other nations signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the biggest multinational trade deals ever.\\nThat agreement now looks dead as Mr Trump has called it a \"horrible deal\" and said that he would block it.\\nThe deal involves 12 nations from around the Pacific Rim, and was partly designed to counter the growing economic power of China.\\nHowever, Mr Trump claims that trade with those nations had already cost the US two million jobs - with the manufacturing of cars and car parts particularly suffering.\\nA lot of work has also gone into a new trade deal between the US and the European Union.\\nSince 2013 the two sides have been negotiating the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP, aimed at removing or reducing trade barriers.\\nThat deal has faced opposition in Europe and now, with a US administration that is sceptical over trade deals, looks even less likely to reach fruition.\\nAn existing deal under threat is the 2011 free trade agreement with South Korea.\\nAccording to figures quoted on Mr Trump\\'s campaign website, the deal has cost 100,000 jobs and has not resulted in any increase in US exports to South Korea.\\nWhile many nations might have their trade deals torn up, the UK might well be looked on favourably by the Trump administration.\\nThe president-elect was a supporter of the UK leaving the European Union and last month his trade adviser Dan DiMicco told the BBC that negotiating a new trade deal with the UK would be \"one of the first things\" that his trade officials would do.\\nMr DiMicco also said that Mr Trump was serious about his threats over trade: \"Things have gotten so bad that we will leave Nafta, WTO [the World Trade Organization] and the Korean Free Trade Agreement if we can\\'t get a fair deal.\\n\"These are not idle threats.\"\\nBut the WTO has congratulated Mr Trump on his victory and appeared to acknowledge his concerns over jobs.\\nThe WTO is \"ready to support the administration to ensure trade is a positive element in a new strategy for development & job creation,\" tweeted director-general Roberto Azevedo.\\n\"It\\'s clear many feel trade isn\\'t working for them.

After the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and the tragedy of the Beijing massacre in 1989, young people are not allowed to demonstrate in China.\\nBut some now hound their enemies online. The underlying rage is reminiscent. The instinct for intimidation is the same. Despite all its strengths and all its engagement with the world, China is once again prey to political groupthink and fear.\\nThe latest trigger is a speech by a Chinese student at an American campus. On 21 May, at an official event, Shuping Yang praised the fresh air and freedom of speech she had found at the University of Maryland.\\nThe video clip of her speech quickly went viral and triggered an outpouring of anger from fellow Chinese students in the US and critics at home. Shuping Yang swiftly apologised, asked forgiveness and said she had no intention to belittle her country. But that was not enough to stop the flood of \"I am proud of China\" posts accusing her of lies and deception, or the online \"human flesh searches\" to dig up incriminating information about her and her family.\\nOf course there are good reasons to be proud of China and every Chinese citizen is entitled to list them. In the past week alone, China has sent a submersible deep into the Mariana Trench and its world champion go player Ke Jie took on the AlphaGo AI computer programme and almost beat it. Every day ordinary Chinese people display the energy, talent and hard work of which their fellow citizens should be proud.\\nBut being proud of China does not mean denying another Chinese citizen the right to an opinion. In fact, Shuping Yang herself said she too was proud in her message of apology.\\nThe irony is that the very backlash against her has only served to make her point about the want of freedom of speech in her homeland. It has also highlighted a conflict between a commitment to free speech in Western countries that host large communities of Chinese students and the growing determination of the Chinese government and some of its citizens that free speech should be limited when it comes to talking about China, even beyond Chinese borders.\\nFreedom of speech is any society\\'s feedback loop. It means precisely the freedom to say what is different or what may even offend. Of course, different societies have a different view on how much of this is appropriate. But if China\\'s freedom of speech goes no further than parroting the leader and attacking those who dare to speak from a different script, then its spirit is lurking in the shadow of the Mao era.\\nWhich brings us to Chairman Xi and his style of leadership. In English Xi Jinping is usually referred to as President Xi. But his power comes from being leader of the Communist Party and since taking up that role five years ago, he has collapsed the distinction between party and government and dramatically shrunk the space for freedom of speech.\\nAll public debate, whether in the media, academia, the legal profession or online, is a shadow of what it was in 2012. It is now off-limits to discuss universal values or liberal democracy.  Instead China must loudly unite around the leadership of the Communist Party and \"tell China\\'s story confidently\".\\nConfidence is understandable. In Xi Jinping\\'s first five-year term, China has become the world\\'s second-largest economy and an increasingly powerful military power. But when Chairman Xi urges journalists, think-tanks and diplomats to \"tell China\\'s story confidently\" he does not mean tell it how you like and with your own nuance. Students abroad are a particularly important voice in this chorus. It is stated Chinese government policy to \"assemble the broad numbers of students abroad as a positive patriotic energy\".\\nAnd so when the University of California San Diego announced that it would host a speech by Tibet\\'s spiritual leader the Dalai Lama next month, the local Chinese Students and Scholars Association consulted with diplomats and threatened \"tough measures to resolutely resist the school\\'s unreasonable behaviour\". At Durham University in the UK, the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, again with the support of the Chinese embassy, attempted to bar from a debate a critic of China\\'s religious policies and human rights record.\\nThis week\\'s mobilisation against Shuping Yang, complete with commentaries in leading state media, is part of this drive for \"positive patriotic energy\".\\nAll of which causes some bafflement on the campuses concerned. Students from countries with a tradition of free speech may feel irritation with someone who criticises their homeland in a public speech, but their instinct is usually to shrug it off or make a joke. Likewise when Chinese state media deploy students from Western countries praising China and its policies, such individuals do not become hate figures for outraged student associations or national newspapers.\\nThat\\'s because liberal societies take differences of opinion for granted. In the US, in Europe and in Australia, citizens regularly excoriate their own governments and praise other countries in the media, and on satirical TV and radio shows. They also mount protests against their leaders.\\nIt is vital to Beijing that these habits should not rub off. So in Chairman Xi\\'s era the numbers of Chinese students studying abroad is going up but their tolerance of diverging views on China is going down.\\nIn one respect, this is puzzling. At great expense, young Chinese have chosen to move from the confines of China\\'s tightly-controlled education system to the \"fresh air\" of campuses which cherish tolerance and which offer all the tools to explore a range of different narratives of their own place in the world through reading and debate. But it is not so puzzling if you factor in these students\\' prior ideological education, the pressure on them to perform academically, and the ever-present and watchful eye of the Chinese state.\\nTension is likely to grow between the liberal values of Western campuses and the \"positive patriotic energy\" of the growing numbers of Chinese students on these campuses. But the very strength of the reaction to Shuping Yang\\'s freedom speech ensures that her words will continue to echo.\\nAfter all, it\\'s not just Western culture which honours a loyal opposition. It is firmly entrenched in the historical memory of China too.

Crucially, it could be digested in acid, reverting to its original components.\\nThis digestion reaction allows the chemical building blocks, or monomers, to be reused.\\n\"It was definitely fortuitous,\" Dr Garcia said. \"The first thing I did, of course, was to hit the literature, to try and see if it\\'d been done before. I just assumed that it had been - it\\'s such a simple reaction.\"\\nBut her search turned up nothing.

       " '\"Stalled,\" she said, before challenging anyone in the room to name a significant change that had taken place in the last two years.\\nSo is she right? Has the much vaunted Burmese reform project ground to a halt?\\nThe answer depends on how narrowly you define reform. When she speaks, Ms Suu Kyi is thinking politics.\\nThe pace of political change has certainly slowed.  In part that\\'s because the easiest reforms took place in the first 18 months of Thein Sein\\'s presidency.\\nIn the Burmese context, \"easy\" means decisions that don\\'t upset the army.\\nPolitical prisoners were released, censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a (flawed) law passed allowing public demonstrations.\\nIn a short period of time, one of the world\\'s most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible.\\nStories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers, and demonstrations, mostly connected to land rights, have become almost daily events.\\nBut the early pace of those changes hasn\\'t been sustained. There was no way it could.\\nSo did the reformers run out of steam? Did Thein Sein\\'s project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army? Or perhaps we\\'re close to the final destination - that is, with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge.\\nMs Suu Kyi\\'s main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged.\\nDrafted in 2008, it entrenches the military\\'s control of political life, guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw (the Burmese parliament), and a veto over any changes to the constitution.\\nThis is what its architects proudly call a \"disciplined democracy\".\\nThe opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most.\\nThey are: the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president, which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power (because of her British sons) and Article 436, which gives the army a veto on constitutional changes.\\nMuch of Ms Suu Kyi\\'s annoyance stems from the fact that the legislature that she joined in 2012, and thus legitimised, is now being cynically used to thwart her ambition.\\nJust as it would in mature democracies, responsibility for shaping the constitutional reform process was handed to a series of parliamentary committees.\\nWith each committee mirroring the composition of the military-dominated Hluttaw, they\\'ve deliberated for months and delivered entirely predictable results.\\nAltering the \"Suu Kyi clause\" has been dismissed outright (as a threat to national sovereignty), while amending Article 436 will be discussed in parliament, though if the army remains opposed there\\'s no way it can be changed.\\nMs Suu Kyi\\'s slim hopes of taking the top job after the election in 2015 now rest on a backroom deal among senior leaders.\\nLooming in many minds is the possibility of a constitutional crisis this time next year. What if the party that wins the most seats is unable or unwilling to nominate a president?\\nThough the changes that Aung San Suu Kyi wants most have stalled, that\\'s not to say there haven\\'t been other important developments.  It\\'s just that they don\\'t directly involve Ms Suu Kyi.\\nEver since independence in 1948, Myanmar has never been truly at peace, with minority ethnic groups fighting guerrilla wars against the Burman-dominated state.\\nThe last three years has seen real progress towards what would be an unprecedented nationwide ceasefire agreement. All the major rebel groups have been brought into the process, attracted by the promise of dialogue on a more federal future.\\nFor President Thein Sein, a peace agreement would be the crowning achievement of what\\'s likely to be his only term in office. Unfortunately for him, with a deal within reach, the number of clashes has begun to increase once more.\\nOutside politics, particularly in the big cities, people\\'s lives are changing fast.\\nThanks to new laws and regulations, Myanmar\\'s economy and banking sectors are liberalising and opening up to the outside world. GDP growth is rapid, though improvements in living standards still lag a long way behind.\\nOn Myanmar\\'s streets two new foreign phone companies are currently battling it out for a lucrative new market.\\nAfter years in which mobile phones and the internet were government-run and SIM cards the preserve of the elite, there\\'s now the prospect of low-cost data and unrestricted access to information. In itself that\\'s a game-changer.\\nSo is the Myanmar reform glass half full or half empty?  It rather depends who you are, and what you\\'re drinking.',\n",
